       "      <td>LOS ANGELES – Back in 2008, Gears of War 2 introduced Horde mode, a co-operative way to play that saw five friends holing up and fending off wave after wave of hideous creatures. When it launches next year, Gears of War 3 will add a new Beast multiplayer mode that lets you and your friends get inside those marauding monsters. I played a few rounds of the promising five-player Beast co-op during a hands-on E3 event here Thursday. We spawned on a map called Mercy, a church where Marcus and his COG buddies attempt to make a final stand. Our mission was to spawn as a variety of deadly creatures and attempt to off the computer-controlled humans. The meatbags aren't exactly helpless – they're armed with the standard COG loadout, and they've also got mounted turrets, barbed wire and laser fences to keep the beasts from running roughshod over them. I started by spawning as the smallest monster – a Ticker. I steered the small, fast-moving suicide bug around the human barricades and self-destructed at the feet of two human gunners. That was two down and many more smoldering splatters of flesh and blood to go. Beast mode is still being tweaked, Gears of War 3's Rod Ferguson told me. When the game ships, players will have to earn the ability to spawn as bigger, meaner monsters by getting kills and causing damage. For the demo, we had free reign to spawn as almost anything we wanted. In this early stage, the creatures were split into four categories. Beasts are nasty little creatures like the Ticker and a new, slithering insectoid called a Serapede. (As this critter, I squirmed around the feet of humans, clamping their legs between my electrically charged tentacles. I racked up more kills as this monster than as any other.) Other categories will be familiar to anybody who has played Gears of War. Within the Humanoid and Drone categories, players can opt to spawn as a gun-wielding locust or play as a Kantus healer. Big beasts like the Boomers prove a real hoot to play. One of the behemoths totes a new gun called The Digger that launches burrowing missiles underground and beneath cover. A Mauler, with its giant flail, can smash human barbed-wire fences with a single swing. Destroying humans isn't as easy as it sounds, though. More than a few times, the A.I. defenders ran out the clock, surviving our attack and forcing us to replay the wave and slaughter more efficiently. Even in this early state, it's easy to tell that Beast mode will be as appealing to co-op gamers as Horde – which, I might add, is being refined and tweaked for Gears of War 3 as well. Gears of War 3 comes out April 2011 for the Xbox 360. Image courtesy Microsoft See Also:</td>\n",

       "      <td>Application Content moderation Safety Text analysis End User Consumer Sector Consumer services Social media Source Data Text Technology Machine learning Natural language processing On Tinder, an opening line can go south pretty quickly. Conversations can easily devolve into negging, harassment, cruelty—or worse. And while there are plenty of Instagram accounts dedicated to exposing these “Tinder nightmares,” when the company looked at its numbers, it found that users reported only a fraction of behavior that violated its community standards. Now, Tinder is turning to artificial intelligence to help people dealing with grossness in the DMs. The popular online dating app will use machine learning to automatically screen for potentially offensive messages. If a message gets flagged in the system, Tinder will ask its recipient: “Does this bother you?” If the answer is yes, Tinder will direct them to its report form. The new feature is available in 11 countries and nine languages currently, with plans to eventually expand to every language and country where the app is used. Major social media platforms like Facebook and Google have enlisted AI for years to help flag and remove violating content. It’s a necessary tactic to moderate the millions of things posted every day. Lately, companies have also started using AI to stage more direct interventions with potentially toxic users. Instagram, for example, recently introduced a feature that detects bullying language and asks users, “Are you sure you want to post this?” Tinder’s approach to trust and safety differs slightly because of the nature of the platform. The language that, in another context, might seem vulgar or offensive can be welcome in a dating context. “One person’s flirtation can very easily become another person’s offense, and context matters a lot,” says Rory Kozoll, Tinder’s head of trust and safety products. That can make it difficult for an algorithm (or a human) to detect when someone crosses a line. Tinder approached the challenge by training its machine-learning model on a trove of messages that users had already reported as inappropriate. Based on that initial data set, the algorithm works to find keywords and patterns that suggest a new message might also be offensive. As it’s exposed to more DMs, in theory, it gets better at predicting which ones are harmful—and which ones are not. The success of machine-learning models like this can be measured in two ways: recall, or how much the algorithm can catch; and precision, or how accurate it is at catching the right things. In Tinder’s case, where the context matters a lot, Kozoll says the algorithm has struggled with precision. Tinder tried coming up with a list of keywords to flag potentially inappropriate messages but found that it didn’t account for the ways certain words can mean different things—like a difference between a message that says, “You must be freezing your butt off in Chicago,” and another message that contains the phrase “your butt.” Still, Tinder hopes to err on the side of asking if a message is bothersome, even if the answer is no. Kozoll says that the same message might be offensive to one person but totally innocuous to another—so it would rather surface anything that’s potentially problematic. (Plus, the algorithm can learn over time which messages are universally harmless from repeated no's.) Ultimately, Kozoll says, Tinder’s goal is to be able to personalize the algorithm, so that each Tinder user will have “a model that is custom built to her tolerances and her preferences.” Online dating in general—not just Tinder—can come with a lot of creepiness, especially for women. In a 2016 Consumers’ Research survey of dating app users, more than half of women reported experiencing harassment, compared to 20 percent of men. And studies have consistently found that women are more likely than men to face sexual harassment on any online platform. In a 2017 Pew survey, 21 percent of women aged 18 to 29 reported being sexually harassed online, versus 9 percent of men in the same age group. It’s enough of an issue that newer dating apps like Bumble have found success in part by marketing itself as a friendlier platform for women, with features like a messaging system where women have to make the first move. (Bumble’s CEO is a former Tinder executive who sued the company for sexual harassment in 2014. The lawsuit was settled without any admission of wrongdoing.) A report by Bloomberg earlier this month, however, questioned whether Bumble’s features actually make online dating any better for women. If women are more commonly the targets of sexual harassment and other unwanted behavior online, they’re also often the ones tasked with cleaning up the problem. Even with AI assistance, social media companies like Twitter and Facebook still struggle with harassment campaigns, hate speech, and other behavior that’s against the rules but perhaps trickier to flag with an algorithm. Critics of these systems argue that the onus falls on victims—of any gender—to report and contain abuse, when the companies ought to take a more active approach to enforcing community standards. Tinder has also followed that pattern. The company provides tools for users to report inappropriate interactions, whether that occurs in messages on the app or if something bad happens offline. (A team of human moderators handle each report on a case-by-case basis. If the same user is reported multiple times, Tinder may ban them from the platform.) At the same time, Tinder does not screen for sex offenders, although its parent company, the Match Group, does for Match.com. A report from Columbia Journalism Investigations in December found that the “lack of a uniform policy allows convicted and accused perpetrators to access Match Group apps and leaves users vulnerable to sexual assault.” Tinder has rolled out other tools to help women, albeit with mixed results. In 2017 the app launched Reactions, which allowed users to respond to DMs with animated emojis; an offensive message might garner an eye roll or a virtual martini glass thrown at the screen. It was announced by “the women of Tinder” as part of its “Menprovement Initiative,” aimed at minimizing harassment. “In our fast-paced world, what woman has time to respond to every act of douchery she encounters?” they wrote. “With Reactions, you can call it out with a single tap. It’s simple. It’s sassy. It’s satisfying.\" TechCrunch called this framing “a bit lackluster” at the time. The initiative didn’t move the needle much—and worse, it seemed to send the message that it was women’s responsibility to teach men not to harass them. Tinder’s latest feature would at first seem to continue the trend by focusing on message recipients again. But the company is now working on a second anti-harassment feature, called Undo, which is meant to discourage people from sending gross messages in the first place. It also uses machine learning to detect potentially offensive messages and then gives users a chance to undo them before sending. “If ‘Does This Bother You’ is about making sure you’re OK, Undo is about asking, ‘Are you sure?’” says Kozoll. Tinder hopes to roll out Undo later this year. Tinder maintains that very few of the interactions on the platform are unsavory, but the company wouldn’t specify how many reports it sees. Kozoll says that so far, prompting people with the “Does this bother you?” message has increased the number of reports by 37 percent. “The volume of inappropriate messages hasn’t changed,” he says. “The goal is that as people become familiar with the fact that we care about this, we hope that it makes the messages go away.” These features come in lockstep with a number of other tools focused on safety. Tinder announced, last week, a new in-app Safety Center that provides educational resources about dating and consent; a more robust photo verification to cut down on bots and catfishing; and an integration with Noonlight, a service that provides real-time tracking and emergency services in the case of a date gone wrong. Users who connect their Tinder profile to Noonlight will have the option to press an emergency button while on a date and will have a security badge that appears in their profile. Elie Seidman, Tinder’s CEO, has compared it to a lawn sign from a security system. None of those initiatives, nor the recent AI tools, will be a silver bullet. And it will be difficult to measure whether or not the new reporting prompts change the behavior on the platform, beyond simply increasing the number of reported messages. Kozoll believes that if people know they can get reported, it will encourage people to think twice about what they type. For now, he says, the point is just to improve the quality of respect and consent on the platform. “Make sure the person you’re talking to wants to be spoken to that way,” he says. “As long as two consenting adults are talking in a way that’s respectful between the two of them, we’re good with it.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>In September 2019, the National Institute of Standards and Technology issued its first-ever warning for an attack on a commercial artificial intelligence algorithm. Security researchers had devised a way to attack a Proofpoint product that uses machine learning to identify spam emails. The system produced email headers that included a “score” of how likely a message was to be spam. But analyzing these scores, along with the contents of messages, made it possible to build a clone of the machine-learning model and craft spam messages that evaded detection. The vulnerability notice may be the first of many. As AI is used more widely, new opportunities for exploiting weak spots in the technology also are emerging. That’s given rise to companies that probe AI systems for vulnerabilities, with the goal of catching malicious input before it can wreak havoc. Startup Robust Intelligence is one such company. Over Zoom, Yaron Singer, its cofounder and CEO, demonstrates a program that uses AI to outwit the AI that reads checks, an early application for modern machine learning. Singer’s program automatically tweaks the intensity of a few pixels that make up the numbers and letters written on the check. This alters what a widely used commercial check-scanning algorithm perceives. A scammer equipped with such a tool could empty a target’s bank account by modifying a legitimate check to add several zeros before depositing it. “In a lot of applications, very, very small changes can lead to dramatically different results,” says Singer, a professor at Harvard who is running his company while on sabbatical in San Francisco. “But the problem runs deeper; it's just the very nature of how we perform machine learning.” Robust Intelligence’s tech is being used by companies including PayPal and NTT Data, as well as a large ride-share company; Singer says he can’t describe how exactly it is being used, for fear of tipping off would-be adversaries. “AI models are just very eager students, and they will do everything they can to solve this narrow problem. Every company [using AI] needs to think about that.” Aleksander Madry, associate professor, MIT The company sells two tools: one that can be used to probe an AI algorithm for weaknesses and another that automatically intercepts potentially problematic inputs—a kind of AI firewall. The probing tool can run an algorithm many times, examining the inputs and outputs and seeking ways to trick it. Such threats are not just theoretical. Researchers have shown how adversarial algorithms can trick real-world AI systems, including autonomous driving systems, text-mining programs, and computer vision code. In one oft-mentioned case, a group of MIT students 3D-printed a turtle that Google software recognized as a rifle, thanks to subtle markings on its surface. “If you're developing machine-learning models right now, then you really have no way to do some kind of red teaming, or penetration testing, for your machine-learning models,” Singer says. Singer’s research focuses on perturbing the input of a machine-learning system to make it misbehave and designing systems to be safe in the first place. Tricking AI systems relies on the fact that they learn from examples and pick up subtle changes in ways that humans do not. By trying multiple carefully chosen inputs—for example, showing altered faces to a face-recognition system—and seeing how the system responds, an “adversarial” algorithm can infer what tweaks to make in order to produce an error or a particular result. Along with the check-fooling system, Singer demonstrates a way of outwitting an online fraud-detection system as part of probing for weaknesses. This fraud system looks for signs that someone making a transaction is actually a bot, based on a wide range of characteristics, including the browser, the operating system, the IP address, and the time. Singer also shows how his company’s tech can deceive commercial image-recognition and face-recognition systems with subtle tweaks to a photo. The face-recognition system concludes that a subtly doctored photo of Benjamin Netanyahu actually shows basketball player Julius Barnes. Singer gives the same pitch to prospective customers worried about how their newfangled AI systems could be subverted, and what that might do to their reputation. By Tom Simonite Some big companies that use AI are starting to develop their own AI defenses. Facebook, for instance, has a \"red team\" that tries to hack its AI systems to identify weak spots. Zico Kolter, chief scientist at the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, says research on defending AI systems is still at an early stage. The German company hired Kolter, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon who works on designing systems so that they are provably robust, to help ensure that the AI systems it is developing, including those used in automotive products, are not vulnerable. Kolter says most efforts to protect commercial systems aim to head off attacks rather than make sure they are not vulnerable. In October, Bosch and 11 other companies, including Microsoft, Nvidia, IBM, and MITRE, released a software framework for probing AI systems for weak spots. A Gartner report from 2019 predicts that by 2022, 30 percent of all cyberattacks on AI systems will themselves leverage some form of AI. Aleksander Madry, an associate professor at MIT who works on machine learning, says it still isn’t clear how to guarantee that AI systems are safe. He adds that the vulnerabilities being exploited reflect a more fundamental weakness with modern AI. But making AI systems more robust may also improve their intelligence. In a paper to be presented at a conference later this month, he and colleagues show that image-recognition algorithms that can withstand adversarial attacks also can be applied more effectively to new tasks, making them more useful. The alien way that AI systems work doesn’t just make them vulnerable to attack, it also means they will fail in surprising ways. This is likely to result in problems in areas like medical imaging and finance, Madry says. “AI models are just very eager students, and they will do everything they can to solve this narrow problem,” he says. “Every company [using AI] needs to think about that.”</td>\n",

MacDonnell Ulsch is the founder of Ulsch Cyber Advisory, guest lecturer at the U.S. Military Academy and a Boston College research fellow. Sign up for a weekly roundup of thought-provoking ideas and debatesArrowRight The Chinese Communist Party’s persecution of the Uyghur people will go down in history as one of the worst human rights tragedies of our time — not just for the abject horror of targeting a population of 11 million for genocide, but also for the advanced technologies that enabled it. Like most Chinese citizens, the Uyghurs have long been under constant high-tech surveillance that tracks, analyzes and records their every move and scours their personal communications for evidence of dissent. Compounding this culture of surveillance is the evolution of artificial intelligence from a novelty designed to win games of chess against humans into a science now capable of facial recognition and individual profiling. The Uyghurs have lived in China since the 9th century, yet their persecution has been driven by 21st-century technology. Beijing has vowed to lead the world in AI, and its documented use in the identification and detention of Uyghurs shows that the regime is getting there quickly. The implications of this campaign are dire. A new study from the Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy offers “clear and convincing” evidence that the repression of Uyghurs goes beyond detention and political indoctrination to ethnic cleansing, not only through death in “internment camps” but also by means of forced abortions and mass sterilization. The most alarming known application of AI in the Uyghurs’ home region of Xinjiang is so-called predictive policing, a disturbing marriage of dogmatic ideology, advanced technology and utter disregard for due process and the rule of law. Predictive policing is not a purely Chinese phenomenon, but an increasingly global one. At its heart is a belief that AI has the potential to make our cities and communities safer by identifying social trends that enable early intervention by law enforcement. But that is not how predictive policing works in practice, and especially not in China. The ministries of Public Security and State Security — the Chinese government’s main law enforcement and intelligence organs, respectively — work hand in hand with state-owned enterprises specializing in surveillance technology, such as the  defense manufacturer China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC). As early as 2016, there were reports that the Chinese Communist Party had directed CETC to develop software that could aggregate and analyze data on individuals’ jobs, hobbies, consumption habits and other social behaviors to predict terrorist acts before they occur, a concept best known from dystopian science fiction. While CETC’s targeting and analysis systems have been invaluable to the government’s efforts to monitor and detain Uyghurs, Chinese president and Communist Party leader Xi Jinping is evidently also determined to tap into the cutting-edge AI research and development done in other countries such as the United States, Britain, Norway, France and India. In 2020, a Chinese investment firm acquired an equity stake in Jina AI, a German start-up that uses deep learning to conduct extensive, highly scalable audio, text and video searches. In 2016, China-based Ant Group acquired a U.S. biometric security company that uses images of the eye to authenticate mobile devices, although recent reports indicate that Ant might soon divest that acquisition in light of increasing U.S.-Chinese tensions. These companies, and others already working with the Chinese government, must be held accountable for contributing to the Xi regime’s ongoing human rights violations. The United States and its allies must respond to companies that enable this genocide by blocking export of AI-enabling technology or through imposed sanctions. A failure by the United States and its allies to act could allow the Chinese party-state to continue to improve its repressive AI-based technology, persecuting religious and ethnic minorities, and exporting homegrown methods of repression even more aggressively than it does now. Such a scenario can and must be avoided. One response is for the United States to organize a coordinated effort to restrain the Chinese government’s ability to further develop AI for its predictive policing program — for example, by bolstering protections against intellectual property theft in this area, enacting punitive sanctions to discourage private technology companies from collaborating with Beijing, and publicly and forcefully decrying the complicity of such companies in the human rights catastrophe in Xinjiang. To be successful, such an effort would need bipartisan support in Washington, to win cooperation from democratic partners around the world and to persuade the private sector through laws and regulations to act in its own long-term interests. Action on this scale is necessary and urgent to curb the Xi regime’s worst authoritarian instincts and minimize the human cost of its oppressive rule.

       "      <td>On Sunday, a disgruntled artist in Miami entered the newly opened Perez Art Museum and broke a vase included in a 2007-2010 work called “Colored Vases” by Chinese dissident artist Ai Wei Wei. Maximo Caminero, who was arrested, cited as inspiration another work by Ai currently on view at the Hirshhorn Museum as part of the exhibition “Damage Control: Art and Destruction Since 1950.” That work, a series of three photographs with the self-explanatory title “Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn,” shows Ai in the before, during and after of destroying a ceramic piece that could be more than 2000 years old. Ai has justified his destruction of the Han urn as an effort to call attention to larger issues of cultural destruction and commodification in contemporary China. I spoke with the Hirshhorn’s interim director Kerry Brougher, who organized the exhibition, about whether there is a difference between the destructive “art” defined by Caminero, and the destruction of a cultural object by Ai.  But how would you explain to, say, an art student who was inspired by your show to value the inherently creative aspects of destruction, who believes that maybe there isn’t a hard-and-fast line between vandalism and creative destruction? That’s an example in which the artist explicitly asked for permission. But aren’t there examples of more purely destructive, or anarchic works in this exhibition?  Was that a guideline for inclusion in the exhibition? I wonder about the perhaps related question of graffiti, when an artist assumes the authority to place their work into the public realm. But what of the larger philosophical question: Can an artist assume on his or her own behalf the authority to “improve” public space? Do you think Caminero succeeded in drawing attention to his cause [which was to demand more representation of local artists in Miami museums]?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Every day, some 50 ships pass through the Suez Canal, the waterway slashed between the Mediteranean and the Red Sea. These are big ships: Some 10 percent of the world’s maritime trade traverses the Suez. But not Wednesday. That’s because a ship called the Ever Given, en route to Rotterdam, Netherlands, from China, is wedged between the canal’s sandy banks. The vessel, operated by Taiwan-based Evergreen Group, is one of the biggest in the world: as long as four football fields, as wide as the wingspan of a Boeing 747, and, thanks to the 200,000 tons of containers stacked on board, as tall as a 12-story building. It might be there a while. It’s not easy to unstick a gigantic shipping vessel, experts say. The Suez Canal Authority, the Egypt-owned body that owns and operates the canal, has not yet said when it expects traffic to resume. Meanwhile, at least 34 ships carrying 379,000 20-foot containers of stuff couldn’t move through the canal in either direction as of Wednesday afternoon, according to the logistics software company Project44. “It’s a pretty major deal” for global trade, says Henry Byers, a maritime and global trade analyst at the logistics data company FreightWaves. It’s very unusual—even unheard of—for ships to get wedged in the Suez Canal like this, says Captain Morgan McManus, who is the master of the training ship at State University of New York Maritime College and has traveled through the canal at least half a dozen times. In the rare event that a ship loses power or control in the canal, it gets laid on the sandy bank, where it’s inspected or repaired. In the meantime, other, smaller ships might be able to pass by. Not the Ever Given. BSM, the ship’s technical manager, said Wednesday “strong winds” had pushed the ship perpendicular to the canal’s banks, with the towering stacks of containers on board acting as a giant sail. Official reports outlining the causes of the incident likely won’t be available for weeks, perhaps even a year, but BSM says no one was hurt. Photos from the scene show the Ever Given’s bow wedged into the sand, while an excavator—dwarfed by the container ship towering above it—attempts to dig it out. “That’s like shooting a BB-gun at a freight train,” says McManus. The rescue of the Ever Given will likely include more motors. Cargo ships have huge ballast tanks, compartments that are filled with water to keep the ships stable. Crews will probably move water into the bow, says Captain John Konrad, the founder of the shipping trade publication gCaptain.com. Then, at high tide, high-powered tug boats will attempt to push or pull the ship out of its position. At least 10 tugs were involved in rescue operations Wednesday. “Things happen in the worst possible places, and this is pretty bad.” Morgan McManus, master of the training ship, State University of New York Maritime College If that doesn’t work, it’s time for cranes. A barge crane could pull containers off the 200,000-ton vessel to help lighten the load and make it easier to maneuver. But photos suggest there may be few places on the bank to safely place a crane or the off-loaded containers. “That would be very challenging to do,” says McManus. “As they always say: Things happen in the worst possible places, and this is pretty bad.” BSM said late Wednesday that it had deployed dredging equipment to clear sand and mud from around the Ever Given. In 2016 a Chinese container ship got wedged in the Elbe River while approaching the port in Hamburg, Germany. It took six days, 12 tug boats, two dredgers, and a well-timed spring tide to free it. In the meantime, crews will have to watch for cracks in the ship’s hull, which can happen when the ship rubs against or is punctured by rocks. Attempts to free the ship also could damage it. “The ship is designed to be floating in water, not on land, so different pressure points on different parts of the vessel could damage the bow,” says McManus. One of the worst possible outcomes: Fuel could leak from the ship into the canal, leading to a lengthy and costly cleanup. Whatever happens during the rescue effort, the Ever Given will have to be hauled elsewhere, anchored, and inspected by divers before it’s cleared to continue on its journey to northern Europe. Byers, the analyst, says that booking records detail some of the ship’s cargo: baby clothes, men’s and boys’ tracksuits, pneumatic tires, electrical appliances, and … ginger. The incident could raise new questions about the container shipping industry, which moves 90 percent of the world’s goods, and its increasingly gigantic ships. Demand for shipping goods by sea has surged during the Covid-19 pandemic, with spot prices for empty containers moving from China to northern Europe rising by more than 400 percent. In response, shipping lines have loaded gigantic vessels like the Ever Given with record numbers of containers. Ships have run into some trouble. The industry has lost more cargo into the sea in late 2020 and early 2021 than in prior years. “We’re going to get to a point where the ships are so large, it becomes a burden,” says Byers. For now, though, the Ever Given needs to get free. “I’m glad I’m not stuck in the canal right now,” says McManus. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.</td>\n",

       "      <td>In today’s attention economy, platforms are megaphones and audiences are income. Shut off the megaphone and the income goes away. Bad guy go bye-bye. Throughout the last year, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and beyond have reckoned with their social responsibility not to amplify and monetize hate in what has become known as “the great deplatforming.” But what about when the megaphone is off and the cash keeps flowing in? A WIRED investigation has uncovered dozens of far-right and white supremacist figures who monetize or have monetized through financial services essential to Twitch and YouTube’s full-time gamers: Streamlabs and StreamElements. Booted off traditional streaming sites, these figures have fled to more underground, less moderated streaming services like DLive, where integrations with Streamlabs and StreamElements let viewers send monetary donations alongside public messages to streamers. Unlike PayPal, which has been cutting off white supremacists since at least 2017, Streamlabs and StreamElements’ role in buoying extremists has flown under the radar. Earlier this week on DLive, white supremacist Patrick Casey played Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice for 350 live viewers. On the bottom of the videofeed, a link to Casey’s StreamElements account was highlighted in yellow. “They are in a real sense their own kind of platforms.” Will Partin, Data &amp; Society Casey was previously the leader of Identity Evropa, a group the Southern Poverty Law Center calls a “white nationalist organization” that later rebranded itself as the American Identity Movement before dissolving last fall. Now he is associated with the Groyper Army, which the Anti-Defamation League calls a white supremacist group. Twitter banned Casey in 2019, and TikTok followed suit late last month. PayPal has banned him too. But on StreamElements, through Casey’s “tip” page, fans can pay a couple of dollars to share a message onscreen with his viewers. As an added draw, Casey’s DLive stream title notes, “SE: TTS + Song Requests,” prompting viewers to donate money and add a song to the stream music queue. They’re not just funneling money to a known white nationalist, they’re cultivating a space, a vibe, a community. Early on in Twitch’s life, streamers could monetize their viewers in one of two ways: subscriptions to their livestreams or advertisements. Around 2012, streamers began soliciting donations to their PayPal accounts—three percent of which PayPal pocketed. A year later, third-party companies (one of which would later become Streamlabs, acquired by Logitech in 2019) began developing tip jars for Twitch streamers, which viewers could access on a given channel’s “About” page. In 2017, Streamlabs founder Mike Le claimed that between 2015 and 2016, tipping volume increased from $43.6 million to $80.2 million on the platform. Unlike a recorded YouTube video, Twitch streams benefited from the novel idea that you, a rando, could interact live with a semi-famous gamer. Streamers realized that in order to keep people coming back they couldn’t simply rely on content, they had to architect communities out of their Twitch.tv pages. That meant reading through the scrolling live chat to the right of their videofeeds and reacting to absurd, hilarious, and kind messages from fans. Streamlabs fit neatly into this model by offering a sure way to grab streamers’ attention: money. Viewers donated $5 tips alongside questions, comments, or insults, often automatically read out loud by a computer voice. In 2016 StreamElements would come along offering similar services; it raised $11.3 million in 2019. A streamer could just post a link to their PayPal or shout-out their Venmo every now and then to scrape together an income. But that would look more like busking than the back-and-forth conversations that fomented countless parasocial relationships through Twitch. Streamlabs and StreamElements stuck because of their social dimension. “It’s the package itself that gives the money meaning,” says Lana Swartz, University of Virginia media studies professor and author of New Money: How Payment Became Social Media. “Without the meaningful dimension, it’s possible many people wouldn’t be inspired to give money and get that immediate reaction and gratification.” Sometimes those messages were as simple as “Love your T-shirt.” It is, however, the internet, and kindness isn’t as easily monetized as hate. Twitch viewers have a long tradition of sending messages to streamers intended to get a rise out of them. In Twitch’s early days, some streamers assumed a dunk-tank approach to monetizing their game streams, reading out loud insults littered with expletives and slurs and reacting for the audience. Please drink bleach, love, WomanH8r666. Others simply laughed as the abuse waterfalled in. In 2014, Steven “Destiny” Bonnell received birthday messages littered with homophobic slurs and anti-Semitic comments. Since that time, more streamers have taken to banning certain words from tip alerts with the services’ profanity filters. Unlike PayPal, Streamlabs and StreamElements aren’t just moving money, and neither takes a cut of donations. They are instead considered “donation management services,” says Will Partin, an analyst for Data &amp; Society, a nonprofit research institute. “But they are in a real sense their own kind of platforms,” he says, due to their social element. “If a platform is software that connects parties—in this case, viewers and streamers—that is what the essence of their business is.” Like most social media platforms, StreamElements has a moderation team that reviews reports about user agreement violations. The company also proactively checks streamers who are widely known to violate StreamElements' terms of service, although Casey's account apparently did not raise any flags. Although PayPal is more of a cut-and-dried payment processor, it does have a clearer history of “moderating” its users when they “act in a manner that is defamatory, trade libelous, threatening or harassing,” as its user agreement reads. PayPal in 2010 froze WikiLeaks’ account, citing a violation of its Acceptable Use Policy. By that time, WikiLeaks had received hundreds of thousands of dollars through PayPal. The company alleged that WikiLeaks was used to “encourage, promote, facilitate or instruct others to engage in illegal activity.” Microsoft principal researcher Tarleton Gillespie recalls the decision as among the first very public instances of a payment service dropping a big-name site. In 2017, PayPal refused to service Identity Evropa (Patrick Casey’s group), as well as 33 other far-right or white supremacist groups following the Charlottesville Unite the Right ralley, The Washington Post reported. At the time, PayPal said its “highly trained team of experts addresses each case individually and carefully evaluates the website itself, any associated organizations, and their adherence to our policy.” “Ten years ago, it was much easier for payment services (and web hosting companies and cloud computing services) to look the other way, and to claim a position of neutrality,” says Gillespie. Increasingly, he says, payment services are willing and ready to slam the ban hammer down on users who may not be doing something illegal but “are crossing other lines that have more commonly been policed by the social media companies, like hate speech.” Despite their similarities to social media, payment processors and donation management services don’t seem to actively seek out and remove bad actors from their money streams. As Tim Gionet, also known as BakedAlaska, livestreamed himself storming the Capitol early January on DLive, donations poured in from his StreamElements account. The tips steadily rolled up the screen: $3.33 “PATRIOTS ARE IN CONTROL,” $3.33 ”seventeen seventy six will commence again.” StreamElements removed BakedAlaska’s account after WIRED reached out for comment in early January. (StreamElements noted in an email this week that it would review any accounts WIRED wanted to bring to its attention, and it removed Casey’s after we reached out for comment.) Shortly before a February 2019 report by the white-supremacy-tracker Angry White Men, Streamlabs removed several accounts operated by far-right figureheads, including Richard Spencer and Nick Fuentes. The Heel Turn Network, which regularly featured Spencer alongside other white nationalist figures, received $874.16 that month from its top 10 donors alone. A spot check earlier this week confirmed that dozens of Streamlabs and StreamElements accounts attached to white supremacist, far-right, or conspiracy theorist content are still live. StreamElements does not display donation amounts, but leading conspiracy theorists and far-right figures have received hundreds of dollars a month through Streamlabs from just their top 10 donors, according to public data from the company. Smaller donations make up the majority of these tips, though, and it is impossible to quantify how much money they receive in total through Streamlabs. Social media organizations are increasingly confident in rooting out segments of their communities that condone or spread hate. But social media is bigger than the intention to connect people over videos, articles, and ideas. Now money is content, and its transfer is social. Until payment platforms take the same degree of responsibility as their more traditional peers, the rot at the heart of the internet will not only persist, it’ll turn a profit. UPDATE 2/4/21 4:55PM ET: This story has been updated with additional details about StreamElements' moderation policies.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A doctored, phony image of President Barack Obama shaking hands with President Hassan Rouhani of Iran. A real photograph of a Muslim girl at a desk doing her homework with Donald J. Trump looming in the background on television. It is not always easy to tell the difference between real and fake photographs. But the pressure to get it right has never been more urgent as the amount of false political content online continues to rise. On Tuesday, Jigsaw, a company that develops cutting-edge tech and is owned by Google’s parent, unveiled a free tool that researchers said could help journalists spot doctored photographs — even ones created with the help of artificial intelligence. Jigsaw, known as Google Ideas when it was founded, said it was testing the tool, called Assembler, with more than a dozen news and fact-checking organizations around the world. They include Animal Politico in Mexico, Rappler in the Philippines and Agence France-Presse. It does not plan to offer the tool to the public. “We observed an evolution in how disinformation was being used to manipulate elections, wage war and disrupt civil society,” Jared Cohen, Jigsaw’s chief executive, wrote in a blog post about Assembler. “But as the tactics of disinformation were evolving, so too were the technologies used to detect and ultimately stop disinformation.” The tool is meant to verify the authenticity of images — or show where they may have been altered. Reporters can feed images into Assembler, which has seven “detectors,” each one built to spot a specific type of photo-manipulation technique. When an image has been manipulated — for instance, two images were merged together or something was deleted from the background — traces of the changes may be left behind. With a computer program that has been trained to learn from being shown example after example of what it should detect, Assembler can analyze an image and highlight where it thinks those traces are. Five of the Assembler’s image detectors were developed by research teams at universities, including the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Naples Federico II in Italy; and the University of Maryland. The models can detect things like color pattern anomalies, areas of an image that have been copied and pasted several times over, and whether more than one camera model was used to create an image. “These detectors cannot completely solve the problem, but they represent an important tool to fight disinformation,” said Luisa Verdoliva, a professor at the Naples university and a visiting scholar at Google AI. The other two detectors were developed by Jigsaw. One was designed to identify “deepfakes,” realistic images that have been heavily manipulated by artificial intelligence in ways meant to mislead an audience. Santiago Andrigo, a Jigsaw product manager, said Assembler might be “most helpful in a situation where a journalist from a large news organization receives a scandalous image and is under pressure to break the news.” It could also be used to verify an image that has gone viral, he said. Jigsaw also announced an interactive platform showing coordinated disinformation campaigns from around the world over the past decade. They include Ukrainian soldiers receiving targeted disinformation encouraging them to defect during the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea; associates of President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines hiring “click armies” to write pro-Duterte comments and stories online; and a small-town California hospital hiring a private firm, Psy-Group, to influence public opinion about a contested seat on the hospital board. The database described the players involved in influence operations, common tactics used and how the falsehoods were spread on social media platforms. Jigsaw worked with the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab to organize the set of around 60 disinformation cases, culled from over 700 investigations, articles and reports the lab published over the last five years. Emerson Brooking, a resident fellow at the lab, said the goal was not to build an encyclopedic list of disinformation campaigns but to create a foundation for “a shared language” to describe the various efforts. That way, they could develop a taxonomy that could help other media outlets and groups studying disinformation, he said. The two projects, Assembler and the disinformation interactive platform, were announced on Jigsaw’s new research publication, The Current.</td>\n",

       "      <td>LOS ANGELES — Laurence D. Fink, the leader and founder of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, had come home. A Bruin to the bone — class of 1974 — he had a story to tell the 5,000 giddy graduates packed into the cavernous basketball arena at the University of California, Los Angeles. Once upon a time he was a rock star on Wall Street. He had big hair and flashed turquoise jewelry, and making money had never seemed so easy. Until it wasn’t. “I screwed up,” Mr. Fink declared, recalling the $100 million he blew thanks to failed mortgage trades in 1986. “And it was bad.” For the graduating millennials, the morality tale resonated not least because it came from a U.C.L.A. grad who had ascended, fallen from and again scaled Wall Street’s treacherous peaks. But it was his description of why he stumbled that truly explained his evolution from down-on-his-luck bond trader to master of a firm that has its eye on a sum about equal to the $16 trillion United States economy. “I had become complacent — too sure of what I thought I knew,” Mr. Fink said. “I believed I had figured out the market. But I was wrong because while I wasn’t watching, the world had changed.” Over the last decade, no other financial firm has gone further in challenging the classic Wall Street moneymaking model for investment banks and traditional mutual fund companies: Hire — and handsomely pay — hotshots to make big bets with other people’s money. The future of finance, Mr. Fink has argued, lies with rules-based, data-driven investment styles such as exchange-traded funds, which track a variety of stock and bond indexes or adhere to a set of financial rules. The idea is that such an approach eliminates at least some of the potential for human error, while lowering costs. It is this notion of using technology to root out investment risks that lies at the heart of BlackRock’s investing strategy. Putting this into practice is the firm’s risk-mitigation platform, Aladdin, which enjoys a ubiquity within the firm — it tracks everything from bond trades to head count — that evokes HAL 9000, the sentient computer in the movie “2001: A Space Odyssey.” Some employees even use Aladdin as a verb, as in, “Has the new portfolio manager been Aladdinized yet?” On Wall Street, prestige and influence have always been functions of a firm’s ability to capture a large amount of what investors call flow — the trillions of dollars in securities that are bought and sold on a given day worldwide. Before the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs’s reputation was made because the choice transactions ran through its bankers and traders. The same could be said of the hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors under Steven A. Cohen, who rose to fame (and also became the target of regulators) on his ability to trade off this cascade. But in today’s world of violent price swings and cash-starved markets, those with near infinite buying power — central banks, sovereign wealth funds and the largest money manager in the land — have become the new arbiters of flow. “We have never seen a paradigm shift like this,” said Anthony J. Perrotta Jr., an analyst with the Tabb Group, which analyzes the structure of financial markets. “It is not about the flow of securities anymore, it is about the flow of information and indications of interest.” BlackRock’s strategy was forged, and ultimately empowered, by two market calamities over the last three decades. The first, of course, was Mr. Fink’s experience at First Boston in 1986, when he bet big on mortgages without assessing how the securities would trade in a period of extreme stress. But BlackRock became the behemoth it is today only after the events of 2008. That is when a souped-up, toxic variety of the securitized mortgages that Mr. Fink helped design years earlier at First Boston imploded — setting off a chain of bank failures and the deepest global economic downturn since the Great Depression. Chastened investment banks were forced to exit these businesses under pressure from regulators. And in stepped BlackRock. Its assets under management swelled as investors — starved for higher returns — piled into the company’s E.T.F.s, which tracked the highflying markets. “The balance of power is now with firms like BlackRock because they have the ‘bid,’” said Mr. Perrotta of Tabb, using Wall Street argot to describe the buying power of large asset managers. The power shift was on display this spring, when Mr. Fink took the stage at an investor conference alongside John Cryan, recently charged with reviving the sagging fortunes of Deutsche Bank, one of the global investment firms that was minting money before the markets collapsed in 2008. While the event was billed as a cozy exchange of ideas between two Wall Street heavy-hitters, it played out instead as a series of slightly peevish questions posed by Mr. Cryan to Mr. Fink. “You are effectively becoming the supplier of liquidity of last resort — beyond the central banks,” Mr. Cryan said to Mr. Fink. The assertion bordered on the impudent — suggesting that BlackRock and its $5 trillion stash of assets had become the new guarantor of stability because of its ability to buy and sell stocks and bonds in times of duress. Investment banks, which previously aspired to this duty, have been complaining for years that the financial system has become riskier because BlackRock and similar firms cannot perform such a market-making function. But to say as much to Mr. Fink directly — and in a room full of investors, no less — was highly unusual. Mr. Fink was clearly irritated by the query. “Well that is not our role — we won’t play that role,” he replied stiffly. It was not the most convincing of replies. Over the last 10 years, Mr. Fink has transformed BlackRock from a bond shop catering to pension funds and insurance companies into an asset-gathering machine that uses advanced technology to reimagine how investors buy, sell and assess the risks of a wide variety of securities. Via its $1 trillion-plus in exchange-traded funds, BlackRock has been instrumental in creating newly liquid markets in high-yield and corporate bonds — a direct attack on the business model of banks like Deutsche Bank. And through its big data-mining risk platform, Aladdin, or Asset Liability and Debt and Derivatives Investment Network, BlackRock says it has developed the market’s most highly evolved framework for stress-testing how securities will respond to certain situations — such as a sudden rise in interest rates or what happens in the event of a political surprise, like Donald J. Trump being elected president. Staffed by 2,300 of BlackRock’s 13,000 employees, Aladdin promises to help firms trade, analyze and keep a compliant eye on the assets they manage. In an era of severe regulatory scrutiny, the service has become quite popular. Seventy-five firms — including Deutsche Bank’s asset management unit and Freddie Mac — managing a total of $10 trillion, now use it. For a man who, in his speeches, consistently spends more time talking about technology and risk analytics than the vagaries of the capital markets, Mr. Fink is no techie. Like many Wall Street titans of his vintage, the 63-year-old Mr. Fink rarely sends emails. An infrequent texter, he does most of his communicating by phone, in meetings or over a plate of spicy pasta at his go-to Italian restaurant in Midtown Manhattan. Mr. Fink maintains a grueling schedule, mixing regular bicoastal trips in the United States with frequent client jaunts to China and the Middle East. “This job requires an enormous commitment,” he said. “The pace is relentless. There will be a day when I wake up one day and say I just can’t do it anymore.” That day remains well in the future, he says. Still, with BlackRock’s growth in size and sway, the issue of who, if anyone, from within the firm is qualified to succeed Mr. Fink has become an existential question for the company’s board of directors. The problem is typical when replacing a founder: Mr. Fink has increased assets to $5 trillion from zero, and the imprint of his domineering personality has become so profound that virtually anyone will suffer to some degree in comparison, considering his track record. After all, in 1983, he structured one of the first collateral mortgage obligations, and along with Lewis Ranieri at Salomon Brothers made it possible for large investors to enter the market for mortgages. A quarter of a century later, Mr. Fink recognized that the time was right for E.T.F.s and — in the depths of the financial crisis — bought Barclays’s iShares business, a deal analysts consider one of the shrewdest in recent Wall Street memory. And beyond a soaring stock price, there are few better ways for a financial chief to command the respect of his peers than to slip through the grasp of regulators. So when Mr. Fink and his high-powered lobbyists in Washington were able to make the case, after the 2008 financial crisis, that major fund companies like BlackRock posed no risks to the markets because of their size, it only added to his aura. There is a moment in Don DeLillo’s “Cosmopolis,” his meditation on the alienating effects of money and machines, when the protagonist financier offers a bit of advice to a colleague. There’s only one thing worth pursuing professionally and intellectually, he says: the interaction between technology and capital — its inseparability. That, more or less, is what Mr. Fink told Dexter Senft, his computer expert at First Boston in 1982. “We are bringing the computer onto the trading floor, Dexter,” Mr. Fink recalls saying at the time. “If we can do this, it will change our business forever.” Not only would Mr. Fink and his bond wizards be able to sell billions of dollars of new securities, giving birth to today’s market for asset backed mortgages, they could also analyze how these securities would trade in certain situations. The immense losses at First Boston in 1986 taught a lesson that eventually shaped BlackRock. Mr. Fink realized that his clients on the “buy side” (the fund managers, insurance companies and pension funds shopping for investments) had become dependent on the ability of the “sell side” (the Wall Street investment banks) to analyze mortgages. That was because few buy-side clients had invested in computers and technology to the level First Boston had. Most money management firms highlight their investment returns first, and risk controls second. BlackRock has taken a reverse approach: It believes that risk analysis, such as gauging how a security will trade if interest rates go up or down, improves investment results. That is where Aladdin comes in. Aladdin is a network of code, trades, chat, algorithms and predictive models that on any given day can highlight vulnerabilities and opportunities connected to the $15 trillion the firm tracks — $10 trillion of which belongs to outside firms that pay BlackRock a fee to have access to the platform. Aladdin fills the monitors of most BlackRock employees. One portfolio manager even went so far as to hang a nearly cinema-size screen on his office wall in order to get the full Aladdin experience. And at the company’s investor day in June, Mr. Fink and other top executives mentioned Aladdin 82 times — more than any other business line — even though the platform represents just 5 percent of the $11.3 billion in revenues BlackRock took in last year. Or consider a recent marketing video that shows Mr. Fink and other top executives gazing at the camera and intoning one after the other, “I am Aladdin.” From Mr. Fink’s early days on Wall Street, his ambition has been stoked by a sense that he has not been receiving the proper credit for his achievements. At First Boston, even though he was among the earliest to popularize trading in mortgage securities, his peers including Mr. Ranieri and others drew more public attention as innovators and moneymakers. As a successful, albeit mostly anonymous, bond manager at BlackRock in the 1990s and 2000s, he saw acclaim, pay and influence go to the chief executives of Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. That began changing only in 2009, when he bought Barclays’s E.T.F. business. Last year he was among a small circle of Wall Street executives to attend the state dinner at the White House for the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. A part of Mr. Fink — a fervent Democrat today — believes he would make a pretty good Treasury secretary, say people who have discussed politics with him. Although he recently persuaded Cheryl Mills, one of Hillary Clinton’s closest advisers, to join the board of BlackRock, the view is fairly strongly held that if Mrs. Clinton becomes president, there is little chance that she will tap a Wall Street insider for the Treasury job. With BlackRock’s stock having more than doubled since 2011, far outpacing the likes of Goldman and JPMorgan and trading close to its record high, it seems that the market has come around to Mr. Fink’s financial worldview: that a low cost, systematic style of investing will, over time, grow faster than the costlier “active investing” model in which individuals, not algorithms, make stock, bond and asset allocation decisions. And the numbers in that regard are arresting. Through July, E.T.F.s and traditional index funds made up 30 percent of total mutual fund assets, according to the Investment Company Institute, a ratio that has doubled in just under 10 years. Of course, with close to $1.5 trillion in actively managed funds, Mr. Fink is not ready to write off a segment of the industry that even after years of outflows clocks in at $11 trillion. And he underlines the importance of being able to offer the best of both active and passive investing styles to BlackRock clients. But inside the firm and out, there is little doubt that he is betting the ranch on E.T.F.s and similarly themed investments choices. These include so-called factor strategies, in which a bet is made on a certain investment outcome — like value stocks outpacing growth stocks, or a basket of low-volatility equities beating the broader indexes. In San Francisco, a team of equity investors deploys data analysis to study the language that a chief executive uses during an earnings call. Does he seem unusually bearish this quarter, compared with last? If so, maybe the stock is a sell. “We have more information than anyone,” Mr. Fink said. Some analysts, in fact, argue that BlackRock should be valued as a technology company, as opposed to an asset manager. Mark Wiedman, 45, a BlackRock executive who is on the short list to succeed Mr. Fink, believes that bond E.T.F.s, in particular, are creating a liquid market where a new generation of bond investors can freely buy and sell. For years, he and Mr. Fink have been pitching insurance companies and pension funds to stop buying individual bonds (from the likes of Deutsche Bank) and instead choose a BlackRock bond E.T.F. Now it’s happening. “I think of E.T.F.s as technology,” Mr. Wiedman said, as he leaned back in a swivel chair in his office. “It is a product that bundles up a bunch of securities, puts them on a screen and makes them easier to trade.” Like many top executives here, Mr. Wiedman can get a bit manic when discussing the subject: Midway through an interview, he felt the need to somewhat violently undo his tie and cast it aside. Regulators are less enthusiastic. Global watchdogs like the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund have described these bountiful flows into and out of BlackRock bond E.T.F.s as a liquidity illusion. Which means, according to Ken Monaghan, an investor in high-yielding corporate bonds, that easy-to-trade E.T.F.s have lured “tourist” investors — people seduced by the rich yields, but who may not be able to stomach a sustained market reversal. And if they all leave at once, watch out. “E.T.F.s do not create liquidity,” said Mr. Monaghan, of the global fund manager Amundi Smith Breeden. “These new investors are not permanent.” Aside from Mr. Wiedman of BlackRock, the short list to succeed Mr. Fink includes Robert S. Kapito, 59, a founding partner and current president of the firm who is seen as the top choice if a handover occurs sooner rather than later. Other candidates are Rob Goldstein, the 42-year-old chief operating officer and driving force behind Aladdin’s growth; Mark McCombe, 50, a former HSBC executive who looks after the firm’s big clients; Rich Kushel, 50, who oversees multi-asset investment strategies for clients; and Gary Shedlin, 52, the chief financial officer. There is also Mark Wiseman, a new hire who joined the firm this month to oversee its equity business. It is a long list, and purposely so. For Mr. Fink, recommending a successor to his board is probably the weightiest decision he will make as BlackRock chief. He has taken pains to not tip his hand. “I want to make sure that the day after I leave, the firm is better off without me,” he said. This spring, Mr. Fink called together more than 100 of the firm’s most senior executives for two days of meetings in Barcelona, Spain. BlackRock was approaching its 30th anniversary and Mr. Fink was in a nostalgic mood. Yet there was an edge to his remarks. Yes, BlackRock was thriving because of its focus on low-risk, low-cost funds and the all-seeing wonders of Aladdin. But now was not the time to coast. “We cannot let someone brand us as a vampire squid,” warned Mr. Fink, referring to a defining article in Rolling Stone magazine that so described Goldman Sachs. Nor was this a time to sit fat and happy on a big pile of assets and let the fees roll in, an indirect slap at actively managed giants such as Franklin Templeton and Pimco, where assets under management have recently been declining. Never before, he said, had the fund management industry been so competitive and changing. “If you think you know everything about our business, you are kidding yourself,” he said. “The biggest question we have to answer is: ‘Are we developing the right leaders?’” And then, looking out over the striving BlackRock executives gathered before him, he put it to them directly. “Are you,” he asked, “prepared to be one of those leaders?”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Tim O’Reilly has been at the cutting edge of the Internet since it went commercial. In fact, he helped take it there: In August 1993 he released the Global Network Navigator, a web page containing information,                                         catalogs and a marketplace, which may have been the first site with advertising. In 2004, he popularized the term “Web 2.0.” The idea was that, far from being just a vehicle for the dot-com bust, the web was a new kind of platform for software development, in which crunching data to                                         manage crowds of developers and customers would be a critical skill. The idea, along with a hugely successful conference of the same name, signified the revival of Silicon Valley after the crash, presaging the dominance                                         of companies like Google and Facebook. Mr. O’Reilly, who also founded and runs the O’Reilly publishing and conference business, now says that the Internet of Things, or IoT, may be the most important online                                         development yet. The term is something of a misnomer, he says, because it is really about giving people greater access to computer intelligence. His conference on the topic, called Solid,                                         will meet for the second year this June. He talked about the promise, and threats, of the IoT in this conversation, which has been condensed and edited. The way most companies sell it, the Internet of Things is about gaining efficiency from putting all kinds of devices online. What is wrong with that definition? The IoT is really about human augmentation. The applications are profoundly different when you have sensors and data driving the decision-making. Can you give me an example? Uber is a company built around location awareness. An Uber driver is an augmented taxi driver, with real-time location awareness. An Uber passenger is an augmented passenger, who knows when the cab will show up. Uber                                         is about eliminating slack time and worry. People would call it “IoT” if there was a driverless car, but it already is part of the IoT. You can measure, test and change things dynamically. The IoT is about the interpolation of computer hardware                                         and software into all sorts of things. But the IoT isn’t just about one sensor in two-way contact with a remote cloud computing battery of servers, or a driver and a rider with a smartphone. There are going to be lots of different data sets, and lots                                         of different feedback loops. The characteristics are that things are contingent, in relationship with other data. They are on demand. They are load-balanced, and aware of other parts of the system. That is why you get things like congestion pricing.                                         It’s a more context-oriented world, because there is better data. Why do you think this isn’t better understood? We’re not letting the IoT teach us enough about what is possible once you add sensors. There is a complex interplay of humans, interfaces and machines. A big question is, How do we create feedback loops from                                         devices to humans? How will businesses learn about this? First thing in a new technology, people do all the obvious things that look like the old market, but more efficiently. In the Internet, GNN had web ads like old newspaper ads. Later there was Google search, which was                                         a different way of doing advertising, by focusing more on data. Now we’ve got social search, social networks. The business model moves to something that is more native to the technology. Uber is an early IoT company. Other businesses will pop up that do more native things. Does more efficiency mean fewer workers? Not necessarily. Apple’s retail stores give workers payment terminals. It puts more people on the floor in stores. Uber has put more drivers on the street in San Francisco than there were taxi drivers. It’s                                         about building information systems in which people make different choices and change their practices. The history of tech is the history of automating things, so we generally need fewer workers in any given field. Yet tech seems to be led now by advertising and consumer-oriented businesses. Is this a disconnect? It’s a weakness that the whole system relies on a consumer economy, when many people aren’t benefiting. Google wanted to go mass with glasses; it would have worked better in some industries. Why not home                                         health workers? If they had something like a Google Glass to show a hospital a picture of something, then that would be a much greater efficiency in an industrial framework. The core now is the sensors, usually in two-way connections, so they deliver data and respond to changing conditions. It’s a new way of exploiting data that makes things possible. There is big data analysis on                                         the back end, understanding and managing things. Can you give me an example? Google Now is such an important product, and people do not understand what it means that they are doing real-time prediction about so many people at once. It has context awareness, alerts and knowledge of my preferences.                                         We will soon expect our devices to anticipate us in all sorts of ways. That sounds creepy. People talk about being “distruptive” here, but I worry about real disruption. The social kind, with massive discontents. Companies are becoming powerful in new ways, which raises questions. Because of their global reach, Google, Facebook, Twitter are all trying to figure out their own foreign policies. The rules are changing because of what happens online — when a hedge fund tries to break the euro                                         with coordinated trading, why isn’t that seen as cyberterrorism against a state?</td>\n",

       "      <td>IN August 1942, the folk painter Thomas Hart Benton watched the first wave of American servicemen board ships at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, headed for North Africa. He used the sketches he made that day as the basis for one of the oversize propaganda murals he created “to wake up the Middle West to the grimness of our national situation.” This painting, “Embarkation (Prelude to Death),” depicts grim soldiers bearing rifles and duffel bags as they head onto a hulking ship. Although the pharmaceutical company Abbott Laboratories financed this work and others as part of a national World War II propaganda campaign, officials at the government’s Office of War Information were not pleased with the results. As the Benton scholar Henry Adams explained, “Why would the army make posters of a painting reminding young soldiers that they are likely to die?” This arresting Surrealist-like painting is currently hanging at the New-York Historical Society, part of the exhibition “WWII &amp; NYC,” which runs through May 27. In choosing to mount a show on World War II, the Historical Society faced the challenge of bringing a fresh approach to a topic that has already been packaged and presented countless times in galleries, films, books, television, comics and more. That challenge is one that institutions routinely encounter when taking on a Top 10 subject or artist that is as familiar to visitors as a favorite bedtime story. This season, several museums are grappling with precisely that task as exhibitions on iconic events or figures like Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol and Henri Matisse open in New York and around the country. In resolving this problem, the Historical Society was aided by its geocentric focus. New York serves as the gateway to an exhibition that concentrates on the home front during the war years. The city was at the heart of much of the country’s preparations, and it was, in turn, transformed by this role. Visitors have the opportunity to see a 16-foot, 7-inch-long section of the 1939 cyclotron that Manhattan Project physicists used to smash atoms, a first step in developing the atomic bomb. There is a red, white and blue checked Maiden Form bra, a result of the company’s successful plea to get the War Production Board, which was rationing material, to declare the brassiere an essential part of the war effort: the ranks of Rosie the Riveters, Maiden Form contended, needed them to do their jobs. Also on display are photos and film of the Stage Door Canteen in Times Square, a place where stars like Bette Davis and Lynn Fontanne served coffee and doughnuts or danced with soldiers regardless of their race. The exhibition pays special attention to the civil rights movement, making the case that it benefited from pioneering integration on the ground in places like the Stuyvesant Town housing development as well as wartime appeals for universal freedom. If the Historical Society uses a narrow lens, the Metropolitan Museum of Art takes the opposite approach with “Regarding Warhol: Fifty Years, Sixty Artists,” which it bills as the first comprehensive look at Warhol’s impact on contemporary art and culture. This sprawling exhibition, which runs through Dec. 30, tackles his outsize influence on everything — portraiture, commerce, film, artists’ materials, choice of subject, gay themes and so on. Visitors have the opportunity to ponder some of Warhol’s greatest hits: Marilyn and Mao, Elvis and Jackie, Campbell’s cans and Brillo boxes. The work is divided into half a dozen sections with themes like appropriation, business and portraiture. In the room dealing with death, for example, are Warhol’s black-and-white blowup of a bloody ambulance crash and his garish orange-hued electric chairs. As expected, homage is paid to Warhol’s influence on artists like Cindy Sherman, Gerhard Richter and Edward Ruscha. John Baldessari explains that Warhol and Pop Art prompted him to ask frequently, “Why can’t that be art?” referring to objects and sights he encountered every day. In the portrait galleries, Chuck Close’s photorealist close-up of Philip Glass shares space with Richard Avedon’s head shot of an aging Truman Capote and Julian Schnabel’s depiction of Barbara Walters constructed out of broken dishes. Robert Mapplethorpe’s performing for his own self-portrait is stationed nearby. Jeff Koons, often considered Warhol’s heir, appears in the exhibition more frequently than anyone besides the master. One gets a sense of some of Mr. Koons’s range by seeing the porcelain and gold life-size statute “Michael Jackson and Bubbles,” as well as his stripped-down vacuums placed under fluorescent lights, reminiscent of the furniture displays he saw as a child in his father’s store. The sheer number of artists represented, however, means that most have only a single work included. Visitors can see Tom Sachs’s 1996 chainsaw composed of Chanel shopping bags, Damien Hirst’s “Medicine Cabinet” (1997-98), or a couple of magazine covers from the 1960s designed by Barbara Kruger. It’s a bit like an introductory course on Western civilization where multiple centuries are covered in a single lecture. The Met does at times note the debt that Warhol owes other artists. In the accompanying audio tour, for example, Alex Katz boasts that the flat background, square shape portraits and repeat images were his innovations. ”I just deal with appearances,” Mr. Katz says, explaining his flattened, affectless approach. “I like it empty.” You can stare at his bright 1964 painting of the art collector Lita Hornick just as Warhol did nearly 50 years ago, according to Mr. Katz, recalling that as he watched Warhol inspect the Hornick portrait, he suspected his contemporary was already planning his own version. Although Warhol was fond of asserting that he had no political ambitions, many artists used his methods to make political statements. Hans Haacke created a giant tribute to Warhol’s iconic red Marlboro cigarette pack but renamed it “Helmsboro” after the right-wing senator from North Carolina, Jesse Helms. Robert Gober created a wallpaper pattern out of two images: one of a sleeping man taken from a Bloomingdale’s ad and the other a lynching of a black man taken from a 1920s cartoon. An occasional nod is given to Warhol’s ventures into other media, like film. “Lonesome Cowboys,” his 1968 satire of the movie western, runs in a loop next to Kalup Linzy‘s 2006 broad farcical video, “As da Art World Might Turn.“ The final room is a recreation of Warhol’s 1966 show at the Leo Castelli Gallery: the walls are covered with fluorescent cow wallpaper while whirring fans, aided now and then by a hand from museum visitors, keep large helium-filled silver balloons aloft. The Met’s attempt at novelty has not been universally appreciated. In the eyes of The New York Times art critic Roberta Smith, it took an “impossibly unwieldy concept“ that despite its riches resulted in an “enthusiastic muddle.“ By contrast, Karen Rosenberg wrote in The Times about the Guggenheim Museum’s success in presenting a new look at Picasso. The museum’s decision to offer the first exhibition of Picasso’s black-and-white artwork might seem like “a glamorous gimmick,” but Ms. Rosenberg judged that this “stripped down and essentialized” view is “a refreshing change from the parade of shows about Picasso’s relationship with women” or “other artists.” What else distinguishes “Picasso Black and White,” which runs through Jan. 23, is the number of works — 38 — that have never previously been publicly displayed in the United States, like “Bust of a Woman With a Hat” (1939). Many people understandably associate Picasso’s monochromatic pictures with war, death and destruction. His greatest achievement in black and white is “Guernica,” a monumental memorial to the northern village in Spain that was brutally bombed by the Germans and Italians in 1937. That painting remains in the Museo Reina Sofia in Spain, but the Guggenheim is able to display three studies that Picasso did for it. This exhibition also contains “Charnel House” (1944-45), his depiction of a murdered family that evokes the piles of skeletal corpses at concentration camps. The purpose of bringing together so many black-and-whites, however, is to show that Picasso treated all sorts of subjects — eroticism, domestic scenes, homages to other painters — with that limited palette. His first large-scale work that uses only black and white is “The Milliner’s Workshop” (1926), a painting of the store across the street from his studio. Also displayed are Picasso’s interpretations of other masterworks like “The Maids of Honor (Las Meninas, after Velázquez)” (1957) and “The Rape of the Sabines” (1962), as well as voluptuous nudes and rapturous kisses. The audio guide maintains that the lack of color in his later work highlights the sexual content. Like Warhol, Picasso may have been influenced by the black-and-white newspapers, newsreels and photographs that characterized much of the media from the last century. Other inspirations also abounded, said Carmen Giménez, a curator of the Guggenheim’s show. The artist’s use of black and white owes something to ancient cave paintings, to the tradition of tonal painting known as grisaille, to Picasso’s interest in classical sculpture and to his own Spanish heritage and artists like El Greco, Velázquez, and Goya, who worked in black. As the Metropolitan’s exhibition notes, Warhol divorced image from color. The Guggenheim’s meditation on Picasso’s monochromatic paintings shows that he did so as well, though it emphasizes that Picasso eschewed color in order to focus on form, structure and space. “You capture more of the reality of a picture in black and white,” says his daughter, Maya Widmaier-Picasso. Whereas Delacroix luxuriated in color, saying that “gray is the enemy of painting,” Picasso, whose treatment of Delacroix’s “The Women of Algiers” (1955) is in black and white, maintained that “color weakens.” The weight of a thousand previous exhibitions did not weigh on curators at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, despite their hosting the work of Ai Weiwei, who has been described as “possibly the world’s most famous living artist.” Their coup this season was to land the first American show dedicated to Mr. Ai, the Chinese artist and activist. Their challenge was to keep his celebrated political achievements from overshadowing his artistic endeavors. Ms. Smith of The Times is skeptical that the show, which runs through Feb. 24, succeeds in this respect. Mr. Ai is probably best known for helping design the Olympic stadium in Beijing, Bird’s Nest, and for demanding an official inquiry into the deaths of thousands of children during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, when hundreds of poorly constructed schools collapsed. In the Hirshhorn’s show, “Ai Weiwei: According to What?” the art is frequently “overshadowed by the celebrity, pronouncements and predicaments of the artist himself,” Ms. Smith writes in her review, suggesting that Mr. Ai “doesn’t make great art as much as make great use — amplified by digital technology — of the role of the artist as public intellectual and social conscience.” The exhibition, which will be reprised at the Brooklyn Museum in 2014, features sculptures and installations, including an enormous snake made out of children’s backpacks that slithers along the galleries’ ceiling and “Kippe,” an agglomeration of wood pieces from Qing dynasty temples. Included in the exhibition are ancient Chinese pots painted in bright neon colors or imprinted with a Coca-Cola logo. (A similar piece by Mr. Ai is in the Met’s Warhol show.) “He Xie,” a creeping mass of red and brown ceramic crabs, refers to a 2010 dinner of river crabs held to honor Mr. Ai’s Shanghai studio before government authorities had it destroyed. (Another 2,500-crab version of “He Xie” is on display at the Mary Boone Gallery in New York.) Mr. Ai, who has been beaten and imprisoned for his outspokenness, has not been able to attend the show or fulfill any of his other international lecture and teaching commitments scheduled for this fall. He has been forbidden to leave China, speak to foreign journalists or use Twitter. Picasso, Warhol and Benton did not suffer the same type of persecution as Mr. Ai has, but as some of their work — and that of their contemporaries — on display this season shows, the line between art and politics is frequently blurred. Trying to figure out where it might lie is one of the puzzles and joys of looking.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The internet is a technology of low-cost communication and connection. Everything from email to e-commerce to social networks has hinged on the internet’s transformative role in changing the economics of communication. All those connections suddenly became both possible and cheap. Artificial intelligence is a technology of low-cost prediction and discovery. It exploits the new resource of the digital age — vast amounts of data — to identify patterns and make predictions. Much of what A.I. does today can be thought of as a prediction. What product to recommend, what ad to show you, what image is in that picture, what move should the robot make next — all are automated predictions. This concept of A.I. as an engine of predictive decision-making is the main theme of a new book by three economists at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, “Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of Artificial Intelligence” (Harvard Business Review Press). The authors, Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans and Avi Goldfarb, argue that A.I.-powered decision-making is poised to alter virtually every industry. To explain, they start with an A.I. leader, Amazon. The online retail giant is constantly learning more and more about its customers’ buying habits and tastes, and the data is steadily improving the predictive power of its A.I. algorithms. Imagine, the authors suggest, that Amazon’s A.I. gets good enough that the company takes the next step — shipping goods before they are ordered. It knows what you want so accurately that returns would be minimal and make Amazon even more efficient. It would also change the nature of shopping “from an opt-in experience to an opt-out experience,” Mr. Agrawal said in an interview. A fanciful thought experiment? Perhaps. But Amazon was granted a patent for “anticipatory shipping” in 2013. Just where artificial intelligence is taking us, at what pace and along what trajectory, is uncertain. The technology, of course, is raising serious questions about its potential impact on jobs, privacy and politics. Still, A.I. is marching into practically every field, from agriculture to the arts. Here are five examples: MEDICINE Brendan Frey studied under Geoffrey Hinton, a scientist and pioneer of so-called deep learning, an A.I. technique that has made remarkable progress in recent years on tasks like image recognition and language translation. For years, Mr. Frey has done research that combines deep-learning and cell biology. Deep Genomics, founded in 2015, is at the forefront of efforts by big companies, start-ups and university researchers to transform the economics of drug discovery. The problem is apparent. It typically takes several years and costs billions of dollars for pharmaceutical companies to bring a new drug to market. Much of the money and time is spent on clinical trials on human subjects. A.I. holds the promise of sharply reducing the amount of costly and lengthy trial and error in traditional drug development and testing. Deep Genomics, based in Toronto, is not only using its technology to winnow the number of target compounds to attack a particular disease, but also to predict the biological outcome in humans. “The guesswork is tremendously reduced,” Mr. Frey said. It is still early for Deep Genomics and its approach. The first of its compounds will be tested in clinical trials beginning in 2020. AGRICULTURE Corporate agriculture deploys an array of high-tech tools including sophisticated weather modeling, soil sensors, genetic seed breeding and drones. But there is another side to agriculture: the 500 million small farms — two hectares or less — that produce most of the developing world’s food. PlantVillage, a research and development project, based at Penn State University, is beginning to bring artificial intelligence to these smaller farms. Scientists at PlantVillage, in collaboration with international organizations, local farm extension programs and engineers at Google, is working to tailor A.I. technology for farmers in Tanzania who have inexpensive smartphones. The initial focus is on cassava, a hearty crop that can survive droughts and barren soil. But plant disease and pests can reduce crop yields by 40 percent or more. PlantVillage and International Institute of Tropical Agriculture have developed a simple A.I. assistant, called Nuru (“light” in Swahili). Wave the phone over a plant leaf, and the software diagnoses the disease or pest blight and suggests low-tech treatments. Once downloaded, the app does not require wireless access to cellular data or remote computing power, which means it works in rural villages. Programs in Kenya and India are underway. In the developed nations, people fear A.I. as a job killer. “But in low-income countries that lack human capital in fields like agricultural science, there is an opportunity to use A.I. to help break the cycle of poverty,” said David Hughes, an entomologist at Penn State and the director of PlantVillage. HEAVY EQUIPMENT An estimated billion people in more than 60 countries step onto a KONE elevator or escalator every day. Its big people-lifting machines are a representative example of the A.I. overhaul underway in businesses that make and service heavy equipment. The Finland-based multinational is using IBM’s Watson software to constantly monitor the performance of its machines. Low-cost sensors, wireless communications, cloud computing and A.I. software are the technical ingredients that make the change possible now. KONE’s new equipment is being made with the sensors and wireless links, while its older models are being retrofitted. Data streams off each machine, every second, providing measurements that include vibration, leveling, braking, temperature, door openings and cargo weight. The data is fed into the A.I. software, which looks for telltale signals that a machine is in need of maintenance or a new part, before it fails. “You go from being reactive to proactive and predictive,” said Larry Wash, an executive vice president of KONE. The results on the elevators deploying the new technology so far are encouraging. There are 25 percent fewer breakdowns and 60 percent fewer customer reports of problems than on elevators serviced on traditional maintenance schedules. INSURANCE Root Insurance, a start-up in Columbus, Ohio, is using artificial intelligence to more accurately price car insurance. Alex Timm, the chief executive, says good drivers pay more than they should, effectively subsidizing the bad-driving culprits — the one third drivers responsible for the majority of accidents. Root is a bet that with modern technology, it can do better, charging good drivers less for auto insurance, up to $100 a month less — and the start-up can still be quite profitable. Since its insurance app was introduced in the fall of 2016, Root has expanded into 20 states to date. Root uses the sensors in a smartphone to measure location, acceleration, braking and turning. The myriad sensor data is parsed by clever software for signals of risky driving behavior — lane changing, tail gating, even texting (typing generates tiny, but measurable, vibrations). Potential customers download the Root app and are monitored for a test-drive period, typically two or three weeks. The algorithmically-vetted safe drivers are approved. “Our models are much more accurately predictive of accidents,” Mr. Timm said. Root insists that it collects data only for its own risk analysis. “We’ve never sold data and never will,” he said. ART In 2015, weirdly morphing images of puppies and celebrity faces appeared in YouTube videos. They immediately became a sensation in the digital art world. Not only was the hallucinogenic imagery remarkable, but it was also the handiwork of Google’s Deep Dream, an A.I. program. Deep Dream used so-called neural networks to digest millions of images, identify visual patterns and then create something new — a kind of aesthetic prediction. Today, many computer artists are using A.I. tools to create new imagery, design interactive visual experiences and probe machine intelligence. Their work benefits from a wealth of A.I. software that is freely shared among computer scientists and artists. In his project “Experiments with Deep Generator Networks,” Gene Kogan used a machine-learning algorithm that learned from many photos on the web, which were labeled in categories like gazebo or butte, and then produced its own version. “It’s a neural network imagining what a gazebo or butte looks like,” said Mr. Kogan, a resident scholar at New York University. Computer art has been around for decades, and Hollywood’s digitally animated movies and special effects are marvels of rich, evocative imagery. But that is more comparable to computer-aided design, with the software serving as a supercharged pencil or paintbrush, still firmly controlled by the human artists. Modern A.I. software is different. “Now, we’re playing with tools that, maybe, — are more akin to human perception and intelligence,” said Golan Levin, a professor of electronic art at Carnegie Mellon University.</td>\n",

       "      <td>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — In a top-secret lab in an undisclosed Bay Area location where robots run free, the future is being imagined. It’s a place where your refrigerator could be connected to the Internet, so it could order groceries when they ran low. Your dinner plate could post to a social network what you’re eating. Your robot could go to the office while you stay home in your pajamas. And you could, perhaps, take an elevator to outer space. These are just a few of the dreams being chased at Google X, the clandestine lab where Google is tackling a list of 100 shoot-for-the-stars ideas. In interviews, a dozen people discussed the list; some work at the lab or elsewhere at Google, and some have been briefed on the project. But none would speak for attribution because Google is so secretive about the effort that many employees do not even know the lab exists. Although most of the ideas on the list are in the conceptual stage, nowhere near reality, two people briefed on the project said one product would be released by the end of the year, although they would not say what it was. “They’re pretty far out in front right now,” said Rodney Brooks, a professor emeritus at M.I.T.’s computer science and artificial intelligence lab and founder of Heartland Robotics. “But Google’s not an ordinary company, so almost nothing applies.” At most Silicon Valley companies, innovation means developing online apps or ads, but Google sees itself as different. Even as Google has grown into a major corporation and tech start-ups are biting at its heels, the lab reflects its ambition to be a place where ground-breaking research and development are happening, in the tradition of Xerox PARC, which developed the modern personal computer in the 1970s. A Google spokeswoman, Jill Hazelbaker, declined to comment on the lab, but said that investing in speculative projects was an important part of Google’s DNA. “While the possibilities are incredibly exciting, please do keep in mind that the sums involved are very small by comparison to the investments we make in our core businesses,” she said. At Google, which uses artificial intelligence techniques and machine learning in its search algorithm, some of the outlandish projects may not be as much of a stretch as they first appear, even though they defy the bounds of the company’s main Web search business. For example, space elevators, a longtime fantasy of Google’s founders and other Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, could collect information or haul things into space. (In theory, they involve rocketless space travel along a cable anchored to Earth.) “Google is collecting the world’s data, so now it could be collecting the solar system’s data,” Mr. Brooks said. Sergey Brin, Google’s co-founder, is deeply involved in the lab, said several people with knowledge of it, and came up with the list of ideas along with Larry Page, Google’s other founder, who worked on Google X before becoming chief executive in April; Eric E. Schmidt, its chairman; and other top executives. “Where I spend my time is farther afield projects, which we hope will graduate to important key businesses in the future,” Mr. Brin said recently, though he did not mention Google X. Google may turn one of the ideas — the driverless cars that it unleashed on California’s roads last year — into a new business. Unimpressed by the innovative spirit of Detroit automakers, Google now is considering manufacturing them in the United States, said a person briefed on the effort. Google could sell navigation or information technology for the cars, and theoretically could show location-based ads to passengers as they zoom by local businesses while playing Angry Birds in the driver’s seat. Robots figure prominently in many of the ideas. They have long captured the imagination of Google engineers, including Mr. Brin, who has already attended a conference through robot instead of in the flesh. Fleets of robots could assist Google with collecting information, replacing the humans that photograph streets for Google Maps, say people with knowledge of Google X. Robots born in the lab could be destined for homes and offices, where they could assist with mundane tasks or allow people to work remotely, they say. Other ideas involve what Google referred to as the “Web of things” at its software developers conference in May — a way of connecting objects to the Internet. Every time anyone uses the Web, it benefits Google, the company argued, so it could be good for Google if home accessories and wearable objects, not just computers, were connected. Among the items that could be connected: a garden planter (so it could be watered from afar); a coffee pot (so it could be set to brew remotely); or a light bulb (so it could be turned off remotely). Google said in May that by the end of this year another team planned to introduce a Web-connected light bulb that could communicate wirelessly with Android devices. One Google engineer familiar with Google X said it was run as mysteriously as the C.I.A. — with two offices, a nondescript one for logistics, on the company’s Mountain View campus, and one for robots, in a secret location. While software engineers toil away elsewhere at Google, the lab is filled with roboticists and electrical engineers. They have been hired from Microsoft, Nokia Labs, Stanford, M.I.T., Carnegie Mellon and New York University. A leader at Google X is Sebastian Thrun, one of the world’s top robotics and artificial intelligence experts, who teaches computer science at Stanford and has developed a driverless car. Also at the lab is Andrew Ng, another Stanford professor, who specializes in applying neuroscience to artificial intelligence to teach robots and machines to operate like people. Johnny Chung Lee, a specialist in human-computer interaction, came to Google X from Microsoft this year after helping develop Microsoft’s Kinect, the video game player that responds to human movement and voice. At Google X, where he is working on the Web of things, according to people familiar with his role, he has the mysterious title of rapid evaluator. Because Google X is a breeding ground for big bets that could turn into colossal failures or Google’s next big business — and it could take years to figure out which — just the idea of these experiments terrifies some shareholders and analysts. “These moon-shot projects are a very Google-y thing for them to do,” said Colin W. Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners. “People don’t love it but they tolerate it because their core search business is firing away.” Mr. Page has tried to appease analysts by saying that crazy projects are a tiny proportion of Google’s work. “There are a few small, speculative projects happening at any one time, but we are very careful stewards of shareholders’ money,” he told analysts in July. “We are not betting the farm on these.”</td>\n",

saw five friends holing up and fending off wave after wave of hideous creatures. When it launches next year, Gears of War 3 will add a new Beast multiplayer mode that lets you and your friends get inside those marauding monsters. I played a few rounds of the promising five-player Beast co-op during a hands-on E3 event here Thursday. We spawned on a map called Mercy, a church where Marcus and his COG buddies attempt to make a final stand. Our mission was to spawn as a variety of deadly creatures and attempt to off the computer-controlled humans. The meatbags aren't exactly helpless – they're armed with the standard COG loadout, and they've also got mounted turrets, barbed wire and laser fences to keep the beasts from running roughshod over them. I started by spawning as the smallest monster – a Ticker. I steered the small, fast-moving suicide bug around the human barricades and self-destructed at the feet of two human gunners. That was two down and many more smoldering splatters of flesh and blood to go. Beast mode is still being tweaked, Gears of War 3's Rod Ferguson told me. When the game ships, players will have to earn the ability to spawn as bigger, meaner monsters by getting kills and causing damage. For the demo, we had free reign to spawn as almost anything we wanted. In this early stage, the creatures were split into four categories. Beasts are nasty little creatures like the Ticker and a new, slithering insectoid called a Serapede. (As this critter, I squirmed around the feet of humans, clamping their legs between my electrically charged tentacles. I racked up more kills as this monster than as any other.) Other categories will be familiar to anybody who has played Gears of War. Within the Humanoid and Drone categories, players can opt to spawn as a gun-wielding locust or play as a Kantus healer. Big beasts like the Boomers prove a real hoot to play. One of the behemoths totes a new gun called The Digger that launches burrowing missiles underground and beneath cover. A Mauler, with its giant flail, can smash human barbed-wire fences with a single swing. Destroying humans isn't as easy as it sounds, though. More than a few times, the A.I. defenders ran out the clock, surviving our attack and forcing us to replay the wave and slaughter more efficiently. Even in this early state, it's easy to tell that Beast mode will be as appealing to co-op gamers as Horde – which, I might add, is being refined and tweaked for Gears of War 3 as well. Gears of War 3 comes out April 2011 for the Xbox 360. Image courtesy Microsoft See Also:    \n",

Text analysis End User Consumer Sector Consumer services Social media Source Data Text Technology Machine learning Natural language processing On Tinder, an opening line can go south pretty quickly. Conversations can easily devolve into negging, harassment, cruelty—or worse. And while there are plenty of Instagram accounts dedicated to exposing these “Tinder nightmares,” when the company looked at its numbers, it found that users reported only a fraction of behavior that violated its community standards. Now, Tinder is turning to artificial intelligence to help people dealing with grossness in the DMs. The popular online dating app will use machine learning to automatically screen for potentially offensive messages. If a message gets flagged in the system, Tinder will ask its recipient: “Does this bother you?” If the answer is yes, Tinder will direct them to its report form. The new feature is available in 11 countries and nine languages currently, with plans to eventually expand to every language and country where the app is used. Major social media platforms like Facebook and Google have enlisted AI for years to help flag and remove violating content. It’s a necessary tactic to moderate the millions of things posted every day. Lately, companies have also started using AI to stage more direct interventions with potentially toxic users. Instagram, for example, recently introduced a feature that detects bullying language and asks users, “Are you sure you want to post this?” Tinder’s approach to trust and safety differs slightly because of the nature of the platform. The language that, in another context, might seem vulgar or offensive can be welcome in a dating context. “One person’s flirtation can very easily become another person’s offense, and context matters a lot,” says Rory Kozoll, Tinder’s head of trust and safety products. That can make it difficult for an algorithm (or a human) to detect when someone crosses a line. Tinder approached the challenge by training its machine-learning model on a trove of messages that users had already reported as inappropriate. Based on that initial data set, the algorithm works to find keywords and patterns that suggest a new message might also be offensive. As it’s exposed to more DMs, in theory, it gets better at predicting which ones are harmful—and which ones are not. The success of machine-learning models like this can be measured in two ways: recall, or how much the algorithm can catch; and precision, or how accurate it is at catching the right things. In Tinder’s case, where the context matters a lot, Kozoll says the algorithm has struggled with precision. Tinder tried coming up with a list of keywords to flag potentially inappropriate messages but found that it didn’t account for the ways certain words can mean different things—like a difference between a message that says, “You must be freezing your butt off in Chicago,” and another message that contains the phrase “your butt.” Still, Tinder hopes to err on the side of asking if a message is bothersome, even if the answer is no. Kozoll says that the same message might be offensive to one person but totally innocuous to another—so it would rather surface anything that’s potentially problematic. (Plus, the algorithm can learn over time which messages are universally harmless from repeated no's.) Ultimately, Kozoll says, Tinder’s goal is to be able to personalize the algorithm, so that each Tinder user will have “a model that is custom built to her tolerances and her preferences.” Online dating in general—not just Tinder—can come with a lot of creepiness, especially for women. In a 2016 Consumers’ Research survey of dating app users, more than half of women reported experiencing harassment, compared to 20 percent of men. And studies have consistently found that women are more likely than men to face sexual harassment on any online platform. In a 2017 Pew survey, 21 percent of women aged 18 to 29 reported being sexually harassed online, versus 9 percent of men in the same age group. It’s enough of an issue that newer dating apps like Bumble have found success in part by marketing itself as a friendlier platform for women, with features like a messaging system where women have to make the first move. (Bumble’s CEO is a former Tinder executive who sued the company for sexual harassment in 2014. The lawsuit was settled without any admission of wrongdoing.) A report by Bloomberg earlier this month, however, questioned whether Bumble’s features actually make online dating any better for women. If women are more commonly the targets of sexual harassment and other unwanted behavior online, they’re also often the ones tasked with cleaning up the problem. Even with AI assistance, social media companies like Twitter and Facebook still struggle with harassment campaigns, hate speech, and other behavior that’s against the rules but perhaps trickier to flag with an algorithm. Critics of these systems argue that the onus falls on victims—of any gender—to report and contain abuse, when the companies ought to take a more active approach to enforcing community standards. Tinder has also followed that pattern. The company provides tools for users to report inappropriate interactions, whether that occurs in messages on the app or if something bad happens offline. (A team of human moderators handle each report on a case-by-case basis. If the same user is reported multiple times, Tinder may ban them from the platform.) At the same time, Tinder does not screen for sex offenders, although its parent company, the Match Group, does for Match.com. A report from Columbia Journalism Investigations in December found that the “lack of a uniform policy allows convicted and accused perpetrators to access Match Group apps and leaves users vulnerable to sexual assault.” Tinder has rolled out other tools to help women, albeit with mixed results. In 2017 the app launched Reactions, which allowed users to respond to DMs with animated emojis; an offensive message might garner an eye roll or a virtual martini glass thrown at the screen. It was announced by “the women of Tinder” as part of its “Menprovement Initiative,” aimed at minimizing harassment. “In our fast-paced world, what woman has time to respond to every act of douchery she encounters?” they wrote. “With Reactions, you can call it out with a single tap. It’s simple. It’s sassy. It’s satisfying.\" TechCrunch called this framing “a bit lackluster” at the time. The initiative didn’t move the needle much—and worse, it seemed to send the message that it was women’s responsibility to teach men not to harass them. Tinder’s latest feature would at first seem to continue the trend by focusing on message recipients again. But the company is now working on a second anti-harassment feature, called Undo, which is meant to discourage people from sending gross messages in the first place. It also uses machine learning to detect potentially offensive messages and then gives users a chance to undo them before sending. “If ‘Does This Bother You’ is about making sure you’re OK, Undo is about asking, ‘Are you sure?’” says Kozoll. Tinder hopes to roll out Undo later this year. Tinder maintains that very few of the interactions on the platform are unsavory, but the company wouldn’t specify how many reports it sees. Kozoll says that so far, prompting people with the “Does this bother you?” message has increased the number of reports by 37 percent. “The volume of inappropriate messages hasn’t changed,” he says. “The goal is that as people become familiar with the fact that we care about this, we hope that it makes the messages go away.” These features come in lockstep with a number of other tools focused on safety. Tinder announced, last week, a new in-app Safety Center that provides educational resources about dating and consent; a more robust photo verification to cut down on bots and catfishing; and an integration with Noonlight, a service that provides real-time tracking and emergency services in the case of a date gone wrong. Users who connect their Tinder profile to Noonlight will have the option to press an emergency button while on a date and will have a security badge that appears in their profile. Elie Seidman, Tinder’s CEO, has compared it to a lawn sign from a security system. None of those initiatives, nor the recent AI tools, will be a silver bullet. And it will be difficult to measure whether or not the new reporting prompts change the behavior on the platform, beyond simply increasing the number of reported messages. Kozoll believes that if people know they can get reported, it will encourage people to think twice about what they type. For now, he says, the point is just to improve the quality of respect and consent on the platform. “Make sure the person you’re talking to wants to be spoken to that way,” he says. “As long as two consenting adults are talking in a way that’s respectful between the two of them, we’re good with it.”    \n",

                                                                                                     In September 2019, the National Institute of Standards and Technology issued its first-ever warning for an attack on a commercial artificial intelligence algorithm. Security researchers had devised a way to attack a Proofpoint product that uses machine learning to identify spam emails. The system produced email headers that included a “score” of how likely a message was to be spam. But analyzing these scores, along with the contents of messages, made it possible to build a clone of the machine-learning model and craft spam messages that evaded detection. The vulnerability notice may be the first of many. As AI is used more widely, new opportunities for exploiting weak spots in the technology also are emerging. That’s given rise to companies that probe AI systems for vulnerabilities, with the goal of catching malicious input before it can wreak havoc. Startup Robust Intelligence is one such company. Over Zoom, Yaron Singer, its cofounder and CEO, demonstrates a program that uses AI to outwit the AI that reads checks, an early application for modern machine learning. Singer’s program automatically tweaks the intensity of a few pixels that make up the numbers and letters written on the check. This alters what a widely used commercial check-scanning algorithm perceives. A scammer equipped with such a tool could empty a target’s bank account by modifying a legitimate check to add several zeros before depositing it. “In a lot of applications, very, very small changes can lead to dramatically different results,” says Singer, a professor at Harvard who is running his company while on sabbatical in San Francisco. “But the problem runs deeper; it's just the very nature of how we perform machine learning.” Robust Intelligence’s tech is being used by companies including PayPal and NTT Data, as well as a large ride-share company; Singer says he can’t describe how exactly it is being used, for fear of tipping off would-be adversaries. “AI models are just very eager students, and they will do everything they can to solve this narrow problem. Every company [using AI] needs to think about that.” Aleksander Madry, associate professor, MIT The company sells two tools: one that can be used to probe an AI algorithm for weaknesses and another that automatically intercepts potentially problematic inputs—a kind of AI firewall. The probing tool can run an algorithm many times, examining the inputs and outputs and seeking ways to trick it. Such threats are not just theoretical. Researchers have shown how adversarial algorithms can trick real-world AI systems, including autonomous driving systems, text-mining programs, and computer vision code. In one oft-mentioned case, a group of MIT students 3D-printed a turtle that Google software recognized as a rifle, thanks to subtle markings on its surface. “If you're developing machine-learning models right now, then you really have no way to do some kind of red teaming, or penetration testing, for your machine-learning models,” Singer says. Singer’s research focuses on perturbing the input of a machine-learning system to make it misbehave and designing systems to be safe in the first place. Tricking AI systems relies on the fact that they learn from examples and pick up subtle changes in ways that humans do not. By trying multiple carefully chosen inputs—for example, showing altered faces to a face-recognition system—and seeing how the system responds, an “adversarial” algorithm can infer what tweaks to make in order to produce an error or a particular result. Along with the check-fooling system, Singer demonstrates a way of outwitting an online fraud-detection system as part of probing for weaknesses. This fraud system looks for signs that someone making a transaction is actually a bot, based on a wide range of characteristics, including the browser, the operating system, the IP address, and the time. Singer also shows how his company’s tech can deceive commercial image-recognition and face-recognition systems with subtle tweaks to a photo. The face-recognition system concludes that a subtly doctored photo of Benjamin Netanyahu actually shows basketball player Julius Barnes. Singer gives the same pitch to prospective customers worried about how their newfangled AI systems could be subverted, and what that might do to their reputation. By Tom Simonite Some big companies that use AI are starting to develop their own AI defenses. Facebook, for instance, has a \"red team\" that tries to hack its AI systems to identify weak spots. Zico Kolter, chief scientist at the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, says research on defending AI systems is still at an early stage. The German company hired Kolter, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon who works on designing systems so that they are provably robust, to help ensure that the AI systems it is developing, including those used in automotive products, are not vulnerable. Kolter says most efforts to protect commercial systems aim to head off attacks rather than make sure they are not vulnerable. In October, Bosch and 11 other companies, including Microsoft, Nvidia, IBM, and MITRE, released a software framework for probing AI systems for weak spots. A Gartner report from 2019 predicts that by 2022, 30 percent of all cyberattacks on AI systems will themselves leverage some form of AI. Aleksander Madry, an associate professor at MIT who works on machine learning, says it still isn’t clear how to guarantee that AI systems are safe. He adds that the vulnerabilities being exploited reflect a more fundamental weakness with modern AI. But making AI systems more robust may also improve their intelligence. In a paper to be presented at a conference later this month, he and colleagues show that image-recognition algorithms that can withstand adversarial attacks also can be applied more effectively to new tasks, making them more useful. The alien way that AI systems work doesn’t just make them vulnerable to attack, it also means they will fail in surprising ways. This is likely to result in problems in areas like medical imaging and finance, Madry says. “AI models are just very eager students, and they will do everything they can to solve this narrow problem,” he says. “Every company [using AI] needs to think about that.”    \n",

Sign up for a weekly roundup of thought-provoking ideas and debatesArrowRight The Chinese Communist Party’s persecution of the Uyghur people will go down in history as one of the worst human rights tragedies of our time — not just for the abject horror of targeting a population of 11 million for genocide, but also for the advanced technologies that enabled it. Like most Chinese citizens, the Uyghurs have long been under constant high-tech surveillance that tracks, analyzes and records their every move and scours their personal communications for evidence of dissent. Compounding this culture of surveillance is the evolution of artificial intelligence from a novelty designed to win games of chess against humans into a science now capable of facial recognition and individual profiling. The Uyghurs have lived in China since the 9th century, yet their persecution has been driven by 21st-century technology. Beijing has vowed to lead the world in AI, and its documented use in the identification and detention of Uyghurs shows that the regime is getting there quickly. The implications of this campaign are dire. A new study from the Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy offers “clear and convincing” evidence that the repression of Uyghurs goes beyond detention and political indoctrination to ethnic cleansing, not only through death in “internment camps” but also by means of forced abortions and mass sterilization. The most alarming known application of AI in the Uyghurs’ home region of Xinjiang is so-called predictive policing, a disturbing marriage of dogmatic ideology, advanced technology and utter disregard for due process and the rule of law. Predictive policing is not a purely Chinese phenomenon, but an increasingly global one. At its heart is a belief that AI has the potential to make our cities and communities safer by identifying social trends that enable early intervention by law enforcement. But that is not how predictive policing works in practice, and especially not in China. The ministries of Public Security and State Security — the Chinese government’s main law enforcement and intelligence organs, respectively — work hand in hand with state-owned enterprises specializing in surveillance technology, such as the  defense manufacturer China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC). As early as 2016, there were reports that the Chinese Communist Party had directed CETC to develop software that could aggregate and analyze data on individuals’ jobs, hobbies, consumption habits and other social behaviors to predict terrorist acts before they occur, a concept best known from dystopian science fiction. While CETC’s targeting and analysis systems have been invaluable to the government’s efforts to monitor and detain Uyghurs, Chinese president and Communist Party leader Xi Jinping is evidently also determined to tap into the cutting-edge AI research and development done in other countries such as the United States, Britain, Norway, France and India. In 2020, a Chinese investment firm acquired an equity stake in Jina AI, a German start-up that uses deep learning to conduct extensive, highly scalable audio, text and video searches. In 2016, China-based Ant Group acquired a U.S. biometric security company that uses images of the eye to authenticate mobile devices, although recent reports indicate that Ant might soon divest that acquisition in light of increasing U.S.-Chinese tensions. These companies, and others already working with the Chinese government, must be held accountable for contributing to the Xi regime’s ongoing human rights violations. The United States and its allies must respond to companies that enable this genocide by blocking export of AI-enabling technology or through imposed sanctions. A failure by the United States and its allies to act could allow the Chinese party-state to continue to improve its repressive AI-based technology, persecuting religious and ethnic minorities, and exporting homegrown methods of repression even more aggressively than it does now. Such a scenario can and must be avoided. One response is for the United States to organize a coordinated effort to restrain the Chinese government’s ability to further develop AI for its predictive policing program — for example, by bolstering protections against intellectual property theft in this area, enacting punitive sanctions to discourage private technology companies from collaborating with Beijing, and publicly and forcefully decrying the complicity of such companies in the human rights catastrophe in Xinjiang. To be successful, such an effort would need bipartisan support in Washington, to win cooperation from democratic partners around the world and to persuade the private sector through laws and regulations to act in its own long-term interests. Action on this scale is necessary and urgent to curb the Xi regime’s worst authoritarian instincts and minimize the human cost of its oppressive rule.

broke a vase included in a 2007-2010 work called “Colored Vases” by Chinese dissident artist Ai Wei Wei. Maximo Caminero, who was arrested, cited as inspiration another work by Ai currently on view at the Hirshhorn Museum as part of the exhibition “Damage Control: Art and Destruction Since 1950.” That work, a series of three photographs with the self-explanatory title “Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn,” shows Ai in the before, during and after of destroying a ceramic piece that could be more than 2000 years old. Ai has justified his destruction of the Han urn as an effort to call attention to larger issues of cultural destruction and commodification in contemporary China. I spoke with the Hirshhorn’s interim director Kerry Brougher, who organized the exhibition, about whether there is a difference between the destructive “art” defined by Caminero, and the destruction of a cultural object by Ai.  But how would you explain to, say, an art student who was inspired by your show to value the inherently creative aspects of destruction, who believes that maybe there isn’t a hard-and-fast line between vandalism and creative destruction? That’s an example in which the artist explicitly asked for permission. But aren’t there examples of more purely destructive, or anarchic works in this exhibition?  Was that a guideline for inclusion in the exhibition? I wonder about the perhaps related question of graffiti, when an artist assumes the authority to place their work into the public realm. But what of the larger philosophical question: Can an artist assume on his or her own behalf the authority to “improve” public space? Do you think Caminero succeeded in drawing attention to his cause [which was to demand more representation of local artists in Miami museums]?   \n",

                                                                                                   Every day, some 50 ships pass through the Suez Canal, the waterway slashed between the Mediteranean and the Red Sea. These are big ships: Some 10 percent of the world’s maritime trade traverses the Suez. But not Wednesday. That’s because a ship called the Ever Given, en route to Rotterdam, Netherlands, from China, is wedged between the canal’s sandy banks. The vessel, operated by Taiwan-based Evergreen Group, is one of the biggest in the world: as long as four football fields, as wide as the wingspan of a Boeing 747, and, thanks to the 200,000 tons of containers stacked on board, as tall as a 12-story building. It might be there a while. It’s not easy to unstick a gigantic shipping vessel, experts say. The Suez Canal Authority, the Egypt-owned body that owns and operates the canal, has not yet said when it expects traffic to resume. Meanwhile, at least 34 ships carrying 379,000 20-foot containers of stuff couldn’t move through the canal in either direction as of Wednesday afternoon, according to the logistics software company Project44. “It’s a pretty major deal” for global trade, says Henry Byers, a maritime and global trade analyst at the logistics data company FreightWaves. It’s very unusual—even unheard of—for ships to get wedged in the Suez Canal like this, says Captain Morgan McManus, who is the master of the training ship at State University of New York Maritime College and has traveled through the canal at least half a dozen times. In the rare event that a ship loses power or control in the canal, it gets laid on the sandy bank, where it’s inspected or repaired. In the meantime, other, smaller ships might be able to pass by. Not the Ever Given. BSM, the ship’s technical manager, said Wednesday “strong winds” had pushed the ship perpendicular to the canal’s banks, with the towering stacks of containers on board acting as a giant sail. Official reports outlining the causes of the incident likely won’t be available for weeks, perhaps even a year, but BSM says no one was hurt. Photos from the scene show the Ever Given’s bow wedged into the sand, while an excavator—dwarfed by the container ship towering above it—attempts to dig it out. “That’s like shooting a BB-gun at a freight train,” says McManus. The rescue of the Ever Given will likely include more motors. Cargo ships have huge ballast tanks, compartments that are filled with water to keep the ships stable. Crews will probably move water into the bow, says Captain John Konrad, the founder of the shipping trade publication gCaptain.com. Then, at high tide, high-powered tug boats will attempt to push or pull the ship out of its position. At least 10 tugs were involved in rescue operations Wednesday. “Things happen in the worst possible places, and this is pretty bad.” Morgan McManus, master of the training ship, State University of New York Maritime College If that doesn’t work, it’s time for cranes. A barge crane could pull containers off the 200,000-ton vessel to help lighten the load and make it easier to maneuver. But photos suggest there may be few places on the bank to safely place a crane or the off-loaded containers. “That would be very challenging to do,” says McManus. “As they always say: Things happen in the worst possible places, and this is pretty bad.” BSM said late Wednesday that it had deployed dredging equipment to clear sand and mud from around the Ever Given. In 2016 a Chinese container ship got wedged in the Elbe River while approaching the port in Hamburg, Germany. It took six days, 12 tug boats, two dredgers, and a well-timed spring tide to free it. In the meantime, crews will have to watch for cracks in the ship’s hull, which can happen when the ship rubs against or is punctured by rocks. Attempts to free the ship also could damage it. “The ship is designed to be floating in water, not on land, so different pressure points on different parts of the vessel could damage the bow,” says McManus. One of the worst possible outcomes: Fuel could leak from the ship into the canal, leading to a lengthy and costly cleanup. Whatever happens during the rescue effort, the Ever Given will have to be hauled elsewhere, anchored, and inspected by divers before it’s cleared to continue on its journey to northern Europe. Byers, the analyst, says that booking records detail some of the ship’s cargo: baby clothes, men’s and boys’ tracksuits, pneumatic tires, electrical appliances, and … ginger. The incident could raise new questions about the container shipping industry, which moves 90 percent of the world’s goods, and its increasingly gigantic ships. Demand for shipping goods by sea has surged during the Covid-19 pandemic, with spot prices for empty containers moving from China to northern Europe rising by more than 400 percent. In response, shipping lines have loaded gigantic vessels like the Ever Given with record numbers of containers. Ships have run into some trouble. The industry has lost more cargo into the sea in late 2020 and early 2021 than in prior years. “We’re going to get to a point where the ships are so large, it becomes a burden,” says Byers. For now, though, the Ever Given needs to get free. “I’m glad I’m not stuck in the canal right now,” says McManus. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.    \n",

                       Westchester County is becoming a magnet for marquee chefs. Michael White’s Altamarea Group, which owns Ristorante Morini, Costata and others in Manhattan, will take over the food and beverage service of the Bedford Post Inn, a Relais & Chateaux property in Bedford, N.Y., owned by Richard Gere and Russell Hernandez. Late last fall, Jean-Georges Vongerichten reopened the Inn at Pound Ridge, not far from the Bedford Post. Mr. White and his partner, Ahmass Fakahany, have named PJ Calapa, the chef at Ai Fiori and Costata, to oversee the food at the Bedford Post. Devin Boyzaka, the chef at the Westend at the Ritz-Carlton in Washington, D.C., will be the chef de cuisine for the inn’s restaurant, the former Farmhouse, which will be renamed Campagna. The food will be Italian and seasonal, and there is also an outdoor terrace grill and a catering space. Mr. Gere and Mr. Hernandez reopened the Bedford Post in 2007; it has eight guest rooms.    \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        In today’s attention economy, platforms are megaphones and audiences are income. Shut off the megaphone and the income goes away. Bad guy go bye-bye. Throughout the last year, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and beyond have reckoned with their social responsibility not to amplify and monetize hate in what has become known as “the great deplatforming.” But what about when the megaphone is off and the cash keeps flowing in? A WIRED investigation has uncovered dozens of far-right and white supremacist figures who monetize or have monetized through financial services essential to Twitch and YouTube’s full-time gamers: Streamlabs and StreamElements. Booted off traditional streaming sites, these figures have fled to more underground, less moderated streaming services like DLive, where integrations with Streamlabs and StreamElements let viewers send monetary donations alongside public messages to streamers. Unlike PayPal, which has been cutting off white supremacists since at least 2017, Streamlabs and StreamElements’ role in buoying extremists has flown under the radar. Earlier this week on DLive, white supremacist Patrick Casey played Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice for 350 live viewers. On the bottom of the videofeed, a link to Casey’s StreamElements account was highlighted in yellow. “They are in a real sense their own kind of platforms.” Will Partin, Data & Society Casey was previously the leader of Identity Evropa, a group the Southern Poverty Law Center calls a “white nationalist organization” that later rebranded itself as the American Identity Movement before dissolving last fall. Now he is associated with the Groyper Army, which the Anti-Defamation League calls a white supremacist group. Twitter banned Casey in 2019, and TikTok followed suit late last month. PayPal has banned him too. But on StreamElements, through Casey’s “tip” page, fans can pay a couple of dollars to share a message onscreen with his viewers. As an added draw, Casey’s DLive stream title notes, “SE: TTS + Song Requests,” prompting viewers to donate money and add a song to the stream music queue. They’re not just funneling money to a known white nationalist, they’re cultivating a space, a vibe, a community. Early on in Twitch’s life, streamers could monetize their viewers in one of two ways: subscriptions to their livestreams or advertisements. Around 2012, streamers began soliciting donations to their PayPal accounts—three percent of which PayPal pocketed. A year later, third-party companies (one of which would later become Streamlabs, acquired by Logitech in 2019) began developing tip jars for Twitch streamers, which viewers could access on a given channel’s “About” page. In 2017, Streamlabs founder Mike Le claimed that between 2015 and 2016, tipping volume increased from $43.6 million to $80.2 million on the platform. Unlike a recorded YouTube video, Twitch streams benefited from the novel idea that you, a rando, could interact live with a semi-famous gamer. Streamers realized that in order to keep people coming back they couldn’t simply rely on content, they had to architect communities out of their Twitch.tv pages. That meant reading through the scrolling live chat to the right of their videofeeds and reacting to absurd, hilarious, and kind messages from fans. Streamlabs fit neatly into this model by offering a sure way to grab streamers’ attention: money. Viewers donated $5 tips alongside questions, comments, or insults, often automatically read out loud by a computer voice. In 2016 StreamElements would come along offering similar services; it raised $11.3 million in 2019. A streamer could just post a link to their PayPal or shout-out their Venmo every now and then to scrape together an income. But that would look more like busking than the back-and-forth conversations that fomented countless parasocial relationships through Twitch. Streamlabs and StreamElements stuck because of their social dimension. “It’s the package itself that gives the money meaning,” says Lana Swartz, University of Virginia media studies professor and author of New Money: How Payment Became Social Media. “Without the meaningful dimension, it’s possible many people wouldn’t be inspired to give money and get that immediate reaction and gratification.” Sometimes those messages were as simple as “Love your T-shirt.” It is, however, the internet, and kindness isn’t as easily monetized as hate. Twitch viewers have a long tradition of sending messages to streamers intended to get a rise out of them. In Twitch’s early days, some streamers assumed a dunk-tank approach to monetizing their game streams, reading out loud insults littered with expletives and slurs and reacting for the audience. Please drink bleach, love, WomanH8r666. Others simply laughed as the abuse waterfalled in. In 2014, Steven “Destiny” Bonnell received birthday messages littered with homophobic slurs and anti-Semitic comments. Since that time, more streamers have taken to banning certain words from tip alerts with the services’ profanity filters. Unlike PayPal, Streamlabs and StreamElements aren’t just moving money, and neither takes a cut of donations. They are instead considered “donation management services,” says Will Partin, an analyst for Data & Society, a nonprofit research institute. “But they are in a real sense their own kind of platforms,” he says, due to their social element. “If a platform is software that connects parties—in this case, viewers and streamers—that is what the essence of their business is.” Like most social media platforms, StreamElements has a moderation team that reviews reports about user agreement violations. The company also proactively checks streamers who are widely known to violate StreamElements' terms of service, although Casey's account apparently did not raise any flags. Although PayPal is more of a cut-and-dried payment processor, it does have a clearer history of “moderating” its users when they “act in a manner that is defamatory, trade libelous, threatening or harassing,” as its user agreement reads. PayPal in 2010 froze WikiLeaks’ account, citing a violation of its Acceptable Use Policy. By that time, WikiLeaks had received hundreds of thousands of dollars through PayPal. The company alleged that WikiLeaks was used to “encourage, promote, facilitate or instruct others to engage in illegal activity.” Microsoft principal researcher Tarleton Gillespie recalls the decision as among the first very public instances of a payment service dropping a big-name site. In 2017, PayPal refused to service Identity Evropa (Patrick Casey’s group), as well as 33 other far-right or white supremacist groups following the Charlottesville Unite the Right ralley, The Washington Post reported. At the time, PayPal said its “highly trained team of experts addresses each case individually and carefully evaluates the website itself, any associated organizations, and their adherence to our policy.” “Ten years ago, it was much easier for payment services (and web hosting companies and cloud computing services) to look the other way, and to claim a position of neutrality,” says Gillespie. Increasingly, he says, payment services are willing and ready to slam the ban hammer down on users who may not be doing something illegal but “are crossing other lines that have more commonly been policed by the social media companies, like hate speech.” Despite their similarities to social media, payment processors and donation management services don’t seem to actively seek out and remove bad actors from their money streams. As Tim Gionet, also known as BakedAlaska, livestreamed himself storming the Capitol early January on DLive, donations poured in from his StreamElements account. The tips steadily rolled up the screen: $3.33 “PATRIOTS ARE IN CONTROL,” $3.33 ”seventeen seventy six will commence again.” StreamElements removed BakedAlaska’s account after WIRED reached out for comment in early January. (StreamElements noted in an email this week that it would review any accounts WIRED wanted to bring to its attention, and it removed Casey’s after we reached out for comment.) Shortly before a February 2019 report by the white-supremacy-tracker Angry White Men, Streamlabs removed several accounts operated by far-right figureheads, including Richard Spencer and Nick Fuentes. The Heel Turn Network, which regularly featured Spencer alongside other white nationalist figures, received $874.16 that month from its top 10 donors alone. A spot check earlier this week confirmed that dozens of Streamlabs and StreamElements accounts attached to white supremacist, far-right, or conspiracy theorist content are still live. StreamElements does not display donation amounts, but leading conspiracy theorists and far-right figures have received hundreds of dollars a month through Streamlabs from just their top 10 donors, according to public data from the company. Smaller donations make up the majority of these tips, though, and it is impossible to quantify how much money they receive in total through Streamlabs. Social media organizations are increasingly confident in rooting out segments of their communities that condone or spread hate. But social media is bigger than the intention to connect people over videos, articles, and ideas. Now money is content, and its transfer is social. Until payment platforms take the same degree of responsibility as their more traditional peers, the rot at the heart of the internet will not only persist, it’ll turn a profit.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   A doctored, phony image of President Barack Obama shaking hands with President Hassan Rouhani of Iran. A real photograph of a Muslim girl at a desk doing her homework with Donald J. Trump looming in the background on television. It is not always easy to tell the difference between real and fake photographs. But the pressure to get it right has never been more urgent as the amount of false political content online continues to rise. On Tuesday, Jigsaw, a company that develops cutting-edge tech and is owned by Google’s parent, unveiled a free tool that researchers said could help journalists spot doctored photographs — even ones created with the help of artificial intelligence. Jigsaw, known as Google Ideas when it was founded, said it was testing the tool, called Assembler, with more than a dozen news and fact-checking organizations around the world. They include Animal Politico in Mexico, Rappler in the Philippines and Agence France-Presse. It does not plan to offer the tool to the public. “We observed an evolution in how disinformation was being used to manipulate elections, wage war and disrupt civil society,” Jared Cohen, Jigsaw’s chief executive, wrote in a blog post about Assembler. “But as the tactics of disinformation were evolving, so too were the technologies used to detect and ultimately stop disinformation.” The tool is meant to verify the authenticity of images — or show where they may have been altered. Reporters can feed images into Assembler, which has seven “detectors,” each one built to spot a specific type of photo-manipulation technique. When an image has been manipulated — for instance, two images were merged together or something was deleted from the background — traces of the changes may be left behind. With a computer program that has been trained to learn from being shown example after example of what it should detect, Assembler can analyze an image and highlight where it thinks those traces are. Five of the Assembler’s image detectors were developed by research teams at universities, including the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Naples Federico II in Italy; and the University of Maryland. The models can detect things like color pattern anomalies, areas of an image that have been copied and pasted several times over, and whether more than one camera model was used to create an image. “These detectors cannot completely solve the problem, but they represent an important tool to fight disinformation,” said Luisa Verdoliva, a professor at the Naples university and a visiting scholar at Google AI. The other two detectors were developed by Jigsaw. One was designed to identify “deepfakes,” realistic images that have been heavily manipulated by artificial intelligence in ways meant to mislead an audience. Santiago Andrigo, a Jigsaw product manager, said Assembler might be “most helpful in a situation where a journalist from a large news organization receives a scandalous image and is under pressure to break the news.” It could also be used to verify an image that has gone viral, he said. Jigsaw also announced an interactive platform showing coordinated disinformation campaigns from around the world over the past decade. They include Ukrainian soldiers receiving targeted disinformation encouraging them to defect during the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea; associates of President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines hiring “click armies” to write pro-Duterte comments and stories online; and a small-town California hospital hiring a private firm, Psy-Group, to influence public opinion about a contested seat on the hospital board. The database described the players involved in influence operations, common tactics used and how the falsehoods were spread on social media platforms. Jigsaw worked with the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab to organize the set of around 60 disinformation cases, culled from over 700 investigations, articles and reports the lab published over the last five years. Emerson Brooking, a resident fellow at the lab, said the goal was not to build an encyclopedic list of disinformation campaigns but to create a foundation for “a shared language” to describe the various efforts. That way, they could develop a taxonomy that could help other media outlets and groups studying disinformation, he said. The two projects, Assembler and the disinformation interactive platform, were announced on Jigsaw’s new research publication, The Current.    \n",
       "16678  LOS ANGELES — Laurence D. Fink, the leader and founder of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, had come home. A Bruin to the bone — class of 1974 — he had a story to tell the 5,000 giddy graduates packed into the cavernous basketball arena at the University of California, Los Angeles. Once upon a time he was a rock star on Wall Street. He had big hair and flashed turquoise jewelry, and making money had never seemed so easy. Until it wasn’t. “I screwed up,” Mr. Fink declared, recalling the $100 million he blew thanks to failed mortgage trades in 1986. “And it was bad.” For the graduating millennials, the morality tale resonated not least because it came from a U.C.L.A. grad who had ascended, fallen from and again scaled Wall Street’s treacherous peaks. But it was his description of why he stumbled that truly explained his evolution from down-on-his-luck bond trader to master of a firm that has its eye on a sum about equal to the $16 trillion United States economy. “I had become complacent — too sure of what I thought I knew,” Mr. Fink said. “I believed I had figured out the market. But I was wrong because while I wasn’t watching, the world had changed.” Over the last decade, no other financial firm has gone further in challenging the classic Wall Street moneymaking model for investment banks and traditional mutual fund companies: Hire — and handsomely pay — hotshots to make big bets with other people’s money. The future of finance, Mr. Fink has argued, lies with rules-based, data-driven investment styles such as exchange-traded funds, which track a variety of stock and bond indexes or adhere to a set of financial rules. The idea is that such an approach eliminates at least some of the potential for human error, while lowering costs. It is this notion of using technology to root out investment risks that lies at the heart of BlackRock’s investing strategy. Putting this into practice is the firm’s risk-mitigation platform, Aladdin, which enjoys a ubiquity within the firm — it tracks everything from bond trades to head count — that evokes HAL 9000, the sentient computer in the movie “2001: A Space Odyssey.” Some employees even use Aladdin as a verb, as in, “Has the new portfolio manager been Aladdinized yet?” On Wall Street, prestige and influence have always been functions of a firm’s ability to capture a large amount of what investors call flow — the trillions of dollars in securities that are bought and sold on a given day worldwide. Before the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs’s reputation was made because the choice transactions ran through its bankers and traders. The same could be said of the hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors under Steven A. Cohen, who rose to fame (and also became the target of regulators) on his ability to trade off this cascade. But in today’s world of violent price swings and cash-starved markets, those with near infinite buying power — central banks, sovereign wealth funds and the largest money manager in the land — have become the new arbiters of flow. “We have never seen a paradigm shift like this,” said Anthony J. Perrotta Jr., an analyst with the Tabb Group, which analyzes the structure of financial markets. “It is not about the flow of securities anymore, it is about the flow of information and indications of interest.” BlackRock’s strategy was forged, and ultimately empowered, by two market calamities over the last three decades. The first, of course, was Mr. Fink’s experience at First Boston in 1986, when he bet big on mortgages without assessing how the securities would trade in a period of extreme stress. But BlackRock became the behemoth it is today only after the events of 2008. That is when a souped-up, toxic variety of the securitized mortgages that Mr. Fink helped design years earlier at First Boston imploded — setting off a chain of bank failures and the deepest global economic downturn since the Great Depression. Chastened investment banks were forced to exit these businesses under pressure from regulators. And in stepped BlackRock. Its assets under management swelled as investors — starved for higher returns — piled into the company’s E.T.F.s, which tracked the highflying markets. “The balance of power is now with firms like BlackRock because they have the ‘bid,’” said Mr. Perrotta of Tabb, using Wall Street argot to describe the buying power of large asset managers. The power shift was on display this spring, when Mr. Fink took the stage at an investor conference alongside John Cryan, recently charged with reviving the sagging fortunes of Deutsche Bank, one of the global investment firms that was minting money before the markets collapsed in 2008. While the event was billed as a cozy exchange of ideas between two Wall Street heavy-hitters, it played out instead as a series of slightly peevish questions posed by Mr. Cryan to Mr. Fink. “You are effectively becoming the supplier of liquidity of last resort — beyond the central banks,” Mr. Cryan said to Mr. Fink. The assertion bordered on the impudent — suggesting that BlackRock and its $5 trillion stash of assets had become the new guarantor of stability because of its ability to buy and sell stocks and bonds in times of duress. Investment banks, which previously aspired to this duty, have been complaining for years that the financial system has become riskier because BlackRock and similar firms cannot perform such a market-making function. But to say as much to Mr. Fink directly — and in a room full of investors, no less — was highly unusual. Mr. Fink was clearly irritated by the query. “Well that is not our role — we won’t play that role,” he replied stiffly. It was not the most convincing of replies. Over the last 10 years, Mr. Fink has transformed BlackRock from a bond shop catering to pension funds and insurance companies into an asset-gathering machine that uses advanced technology to reimagine how investors buy, sell and assess the risks of a wide variety of securities. Via its $1 trillion-plus in exchange-traded funds, BlackRock has been instrumental in creating newly liquid markets in high-yield and corporate bonds — a direct attack on the business model of banks like Deutsche Bank. And through its big data-mining risk platform, Aladdin, or Asset Liability and Debt and Derivatives Investment Network, BlackRock says it has developed the market’s most highly evolved framework for stress-testing how securities will respond to certain situations — such as a sudden rise in interest rates or what happens in the event of a political surprise, like Donald J. Trump being elected president. Staffed by 2,300 of BlackRock’s 13,000 employees, Aladdin promises to help firms trade, analyze and keep a compliant eye on the assets they manage. In an era of severe regulatory scrutiny, the service has become quite popular. Seventy-five firms — including Deutsche Bank’s asset management unit and Freddie Mac — managing a total of $10 trillion, now use it. For a man who, in his speeches, consistently spends more time talking about technology and risk analytics than the vagaries of the capital markets, Mr. Fink is no techie. Like many Wall Street titans of his vintage, the 63-year-old Mr. Fink rarely sends emails. An infrequent texter, he does most of his communicating by phone, in meetings or over a plate of spicy pasta at his go-to Italian restaurant in Midtown Manhattan. Mr. Fink maintains a grueling schedule, mixing regular bicoastal trips in the United States with frequent client jaunts to China and the Middle East. “This job requires an enormous commitment,” he said. “The pace is relentless. There will be a day when I wake up one day and say I just can’t do it anymore.” That day remains well in the future, he says. Still, with BlackRock’s growth in size and sway, the issue of who, if anyone, from within the firm is qualified to succeed Mr. Fink has become an existential question for the company’s board of directors. The problem is typical when replacing a founder: Mr. Fink has increased assets to $5 trillion from zero, and the imprint of his domineering personality has become so profound that virtually anyone will suffer to some degree in comparison, considering his track record. After all, in 1983, he structured one of the first collateral mortgage obligations, and along with Lewis Ranieri at Salomon Brothers made it possible for large investors to enter the market for mortgages. A quarter of a century later, Mr. Fink recognized that the time was right for E.T.F.s and — in the depths of the financial crisis — bought Barclays’s iShares business, a deal analysts consider one of the shrewdest in recent Wall Street memory. And beyond a soaring stock price, there are few better ways for a financial chief to command the respect of his peers than to slip through the grasp of regulators. So when Mr. Fink and his high-powered lobbyists in Washington were able to make the case, after the 2008 financial crisis, that major fund companies like BlackRock posed no risks to the markets because of their size, it only added to his aura. There is a moment in Don DeLillo’s “Cosmopolis,” his meditation on the alienating effects of money and machines, when the protagonist financier offers a bit of advice to a colleague. There’s only one thing worth pursuing professionally and intellectually, he says: the interaction between technology and capital — its inseparability. That, more or less, is what Mr. Fink told Dexter Senft, his computer expert at First Boston in 1982. “We are bringing the computer onto the trading floor, Dexter,” Mr. Fink recalls saying at the time. “If we can do this, it will change our business forever.” Not only would Mr. Fink and his bond wizards be able to sell billions of dollars of new securities, giving birth to today’s market for asset backed mortgages, they could also analyze how these securities would trade in certain situations. The immense losses at First Boston in 1986 taught a lesson that eventually shaped BlackRock. Mr. Fink realized that his clients on the “buy side” (the fund managers, insurance companies and pension funds shopping for investments) had become dependent on the ability of the “sell side” (the Wall Street investment banks) to analyze mortgages. That was because few buy-side clients had invested in computers and technology to the level First Boston had. Most money management firms highlight their investment returns first, and risk controls second. BlackRock has taken a reverse approach: It believes that risk analysis, such as gauging how a security will trade if interest rates go up or down, improves investment results. That is where Aladdin comes in. Aladdin is a network of code, trades, chat, algorithms and predictive models that on any given day can highlight vulnerabilities and opportunities connected to the $15 trillion the firm tracks — $10 trillion of which belongs to outside firms that pay BlackRock a fee to have access to the platform. Aladdin fills the monitors of most BlackRock employees. One portfolio manager even went so far as to hang a nearly cinema-size screen on his office wall in order to get the full Aladdin experience. And at the company’s investor day in June, Mr. Fink and other top executives mentioned Aladdin 82 times — more than any other business line — even though the platform represents just 5 percent of the $11.3 billion in revenues BlackRock took in last year. Or consider a recent marketing video that shows Mr. Fink and other top executives gazing at the camera and intoning one after the other, “I am Aladdin.” From Mr. Fink’s early days on Wall Street, his ambition has been stoked by a sense that he has not been receiving the proper credit for his achievements. At First Boston, even though he was among the earliest to popularize trading in mortgage securities, his peers including Mr. Ranieri and others drew more public attention as innovators and moneymakers. As a successful, albeit mostly anonymous, bond manager at BlackRock in the 1990s and 2000s, he saw acclaim, pay and influence go to the chief executives of Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. That began changing only in 2009, when he bought Barclays’s E.T.F. business. Last year he was among a small circle of Wall Street executives to attend the state dinner at the White House for the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. A part of Mr. Fink — a fervent Democrat today — believes he would make a pretty good Treasury secretary, say people who have discussed politics with him. Although he recently persuaded Cheryl Mills, one of Hillary Clinton’s closest advisers, to join the board of BlackRock, the view is fairly strongly held that if Mrs. Clinton becomes president, there is little chance that she will tap a Wall Street insider for the Treasury job. With BlackRock’s stock having more than doubled since 2011, far outpacing the likes of Goldman and JPMorgan and trading close to its record high, it seems that the market has come around to Mr. Fink’s financial worldview: that a low cost, systematic style of investing will, over time, grow faster than the costlier “active investing” model in which individuals, not algorithms, make stock, bond and asset allocation decisions. And the numbers in that regard are arresting. Through July, E.T.F.s and traditional index funds made up 30 percent of total mutual fund assets, according to the Investment Company Institute, a ratio that has doubled in just under 10 years. Of course, with close to $1.5 trillion in actively managed funds, Mr. Fink is not ready to write off a segment of the industry that even after years of outflows clocks in at $11 trillion. And he underlines the importance of being able to offer the best of both active and passive investing styles to BlackRock clients. But inside the firm and out, there is little doubt that he is betting the ranch on E.T.F.s and similarly themed investments choices. These include so-called factor strategies, in which a bet is made on a certain investment outcome — like value stocks outpacing growth stocks, or a basket of low-volatility equities beating the broader indexes. In San Francisco, a team of equity investors deploys data analysis to study the language that a chief executive uses during an earnings call. Does he seem unusually bearish this quarter, compared with last? If so, maybe the stock is a sell. “We have more information than anyone,” Mr. Fink said. Some analysts, in fact, argue that BlackRock should be valued as a technology company, as opposed to an asset manager. Mark Wiedman, 45, a BlackRock executive who is on the short list to succeed Mr. Fink, believes that bond E.T.F.s, in particular, are creating a liquid market where a new generation of bond investors can freely buy and sell. For years, he and Mr. Fink have been pitching insurance companies and pension funds to stop buying individual bonds (from the likes of Deutsche Bank) and instead choose a BlackRock bond E.T.F. Now it’s happening. “I think of E.T.F.s as technology,” Mr. Wiedman said, as he leaned back in a swivel chair in his office. “It is a product that bundles up a bunch of securities, puts them on a screen and makes them easier to trade.” Like many top executives here, Mr. Wiedman can get a bit manic when discussing the subject: Midway through an interview, he felt the need to somewhat violently undo his tie and cast it aside. Regulators are less enthusiastic. Global watchdogs like the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund have described these bountiful flows into and out of BlackRock bond E.T.F.s as a liquidity illusion. Which means, according to Ken Monaghan, an investor in high-yielding corporate bonds, that easy-to-trade E.T.F.s have lured “tourist” investors — people seduced by the rich yields, but who may not be able to stomach a sustained market reversal. And if they all leave at once, watch out. “E.T.F.s do not create liquidity,” said Mr. Monaghan, of the global fund manager Amundi Smith Breeden. “These new investors are not permanent.” Aside from Mr. Wiedman of BlackRock, the short list to succeed Mr. Fink includes Robert S. Kapito, 59, a founding partner and current president of the firm who is seen as the top choice if a handover occurs sooner rather than later. Other candidates are Rob Goldstein, the 42-year-old chief operating officer and driving force behind Aladdin’s growth; Mark McCombe, 50, a former HSBC executive who looks after the firm’s big clients; Rich Kushel, 50, who oversees multi-asset investment strategies for clients; and Gary Shedlin, 52, the chief financial officer. There is also Mark Wiseman, a new hire who joined the firm this month to oversee its equity business. It is a long list, and purposely so. For Mr. Fink, recommending a successor to his board is probably the weightiest decision he will make as BlackRock chief. He has taken pains to not tip his hand. “I want to make sure that the day after I leave, the firm is better off without me,” he said. This spring, Mr. Fink called together more than 100 of the firm’s most senior executives for two days of meetings in Barcelona, Spain. BlackRock was approaching its 30th anniversary and Mr. Fink was in a nostalgic mood. Yet there was an edge to his remarks. Yes, BlackRock was thriving because of its focus on low-risk, low-cost funds and the all-seeing wonders of Aladdin. But now was not the time to coast. “We cannot let someone brand us as a vampire squid,” warned Mr. Fink, referring to a defining article in Rolling Stone magazine that so described Goldman Sachs. Nor was this a time to sit fat and happy on a big pile of assets and let the fees roll in, an indirect slap at actively managed giants such as Franklin Templeton and Pimco, where assets under management have recently been declining. Never before, he said, had the fund management industry been so competitive and changing. “If you think you know everything about our business, you are kidding yourself,” he said. “The biggest question we have to answer is: ‘Are we developing the right leaders?’” And then, looking out over the striving BlackRock executives gathered before him, he put it to them directly. “Are you,” he asked, “prepared to be one of those leaders?”    \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Tim O’Reilly has been at the cutting edge of the Internet since it went commercial. In fact, he helped take it there: In August 1993 he released the Global Network Navigator, a web page containing information,                                         catalogs and a marketplace, which may have been the first site with advertising. In 2004, he popularized the term “Web 2.0.” The idea was that, far from being just a vehicle for the dot-com bust, the web was a new kind of platform for software development, in which crunching data to                                         manage crowds of developers and customers would be a critical skill. The idea, along with a hugely successful conference of the same name, signified the revival of Silicon Valley after the crash, presaging the dominance                                         of companies like Google and Facebook. Mr. O’Reilly, who also founded and runs the O’Reilly publishing and conference business, now says that the Internet of Things, or IoT, may be the most important online                                         development yet. The term is something of a misnomer, he says, because it is really about giving people greater access to computer intelligence. His conference on the topic, called Solid,                                         will meet for the second year this June. He talked about the promise, and threats, of the IoT in this conversation, which has been condensed and edited. The way most companies sell it, the Internet of Things is about gaining efficiency from putting all kinds of devices online. What is wrong with that definition? The IoT is really about human augmentation. The applications are profoundly different when you have sensors and data driving the decision-making. Can you give me an example? Uber is a company built around location awareness. An Uber driver is an augmented taxi driver, with real-time location awareness. An Uber passenger is an augmented passenger, who knows when the cab will show up. Uber                                         is about eliminating slack time and worry. People would call it “IoT” if there was a driverless car, but it already is part of the IoT. You can measure, test and change things dynamically. The IoT is about the interpolation of computer hardware                                         and software into all sorts of things. But the IoT isn’t just about one sensor in two-way contact with a remote cloud computing battery of servers, or a driver and a rider with a smartphone. There are going to be lots of different data sets, and lots                                         of different feedback loops. The characteristics are that things are contingent, in relationship with other data. They are on demand. They are load-balanced, and aware of other parts of the system. That is why you get things like congestion pricing.                                         It’s a more context-oriented world, because there is better data. Why do you think this isn’t better understood? We’re not letting the IoT teach us enough about what is possible once you add sensors. There is a complex interplay of humans, interfaces and machines. A big question is, How do we create feedback loops from                                         devices to humans? How will businesses learn about this? First thing in a new technology, people do all the obvious things that look like the old market, but more efficiently. In the Internet, GNN had web ads like old newspaper ads. Later there was Google search, which was                                         a different way of doing advertising, by focusing more on data. Now we’ve got social search, social networks. The business model moves to something that is more native to the technology. Uber is an early IoT company. Other businesses will pop up that do more native things. Does more efficiency mean fewer workers? Not necessarily. Apple’s retail stores give workers payment terminals. It puts more people on the floor in stores. Uber has put more drivers on the street in San Francisco than there were taxi drivers. It’s                                         about building information systems in which people make different choices and change their practices. The history of tech is the history of automating things, so we generally need fewer workers in any given field. Yet tech seems to be led now by advertising and consumer-oriented businesses. Is this a disconnect? It’s a weakness that the whole system relies on a consumer economy, when many people aren’t benefiting. Google wanted to go mass with glasses; it would have worked better in some industries. Why not home                                         health workers? If they had something like a Google Glass to show a hospital a picture of something, then that would be a much greater efficiency in an industrial framework. The core now is the sensors, usually in two-way connections, so they deliver data and respond to changing conditions. It’s a new way of exploiting data that makes things possible. There is big data analysis on                                         the back end, understanding and managing things. Can you give me an example? Google Now is such an important product, and people do not understand what it means that they are doing real-time prediction about so many people at once. It has context awareness, alerts and knowledge of my preferences.                                         We will soon expect our devices to anticipate us in all sorts of ways. That sounds creepy. People talk about being “distruptive” here, but I worry about real disruption. The social kind, with massive discontents. Companies are becoming powerful in new ways, which raises questions. Because of their global reach, Google, Facebook, Twitter are all trying to figure out their own foreign policies. The rules are changing because of what happens online — when a hedge fund tries to break the euro                                         with coordinated trading, why isn’t that seen as cyberterrorism against a state?    \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              IN August 1942, the folk painter Thomas Hart Benton watched the first wave of American servicemen board ships at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, headed for North Africa. He used the sketches he made that day as the basis for one of the oversize propaganda murals he created “to wake up the Middle West to the grimness of our national situation.” This painting, “Embarkation (Prelude to Death),” depicts grim soldiers bearing rifles and duffel bags as they head onto a hulking ship. Although the pharmaceutical company Abbott Laboratories financed this work and others as part of a national World War II propaganda campaign, officials at the government’s Office of War Information were not pleased with the results. As the Benton scholar Henry Adams explained, “Why would the army make posters of a painting reminding young soldiers that they are likely to die?” This arresting Surrealist-like painting is currently hanging at the New-York Historical Society, part of the exhibition “WWII & NYC,” which runs through May 27. In choosing to mount a show on World War II, the Historical Society faced the challenge of bringing a fresh approach to a topic that has already been packaged and presented countless times in galleries, films, books, television, comics and more. That challenge is one that institutions routinely encounter when taking on a Top 10 subject or artist that is as familiar to visitors as a favorite bedtime story. This season, several museums are grappling with precisely that task as exhibitions on iconic events or figures like Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol and Henri Matisse open in New York and around the country. In resolving this problem, the Historical Society was aided by its geocentric focus. New York serves as the gateway to an exhibition that concentrates on the home front during the war years. The city was at the heart of much of the country’s preparations, and it was, in turn, transformed by this role. Visitors have the opportunity to see a 16-foot, 7-inch-long section of the 1939 cyclotron that Manhattan Project physicists used to smash atoms, a first step in developing the atomic bomb. There is a red, white and blue checked Maiden Form bra, a result of the company’s successful plea to get the War Production Board, which was rationing material, to declare the brassiere an essential part of the war effort: the ranks of Rosie the Riveters, Maiden Form contended, needed them to do their jobs. Also on display are photos and film of the Stage Door Canteen in Times Square, a place where stars like Bette Davis and Lynn Fontanne served coffee and doughnuts or danced with soldiers regardless of their race. The exhibition pays special attention to the civil rights movement, making the case that it benefited from pioneering integration on the ground in places like the Stuyvesant Town housing development as well as wartime appeals for universal freedom. If the Historical Society uses a narrow lens, the Metropolitan Museum of Art takes the opposite approach with “Regarding Warhol: Fifty Years, Sixty Artists,” which it bills as the first comprehensive look at Warhol’s impact on contemporary art and culture. This sprawling exhibition, which runs through Dec. 30, tackles his outsize influence on everything — portraiture, commerce, film, artists’ materials, choice of subject, gay themes and so on. Visitors have the opportunity to ponder some of Warhol’s greatest hits: Marilyn and Mao, Elvis and Jackie, Campbell’s cans and Brillo boxes. The work is divided into half a dozen sections with themes like appropriation, business and portraiture. In the room dealing with death, for example, are Warhol’s black-and-white blowup of a bloody ambulance crash and his garish orange-hued electric chairs. As expected, homage is paid to Warhol’s influence on artists like Cindy Sherman, Gerhard Richter and Edward Ruscha. John Baldessari explains that Warhol and Pop Art prompted him to ask frequently, “Why can’t that be art?” referring to objects and sights he encountered every day. In the portrait galleries, Chuck Close’s photorealist close-up of Philip Glass shares space with Richard Avedon’s head shot of an aging Truman Capote and Julian Schnabel’s depiction of Barbara Walters constructed out of broken dishes. Robert Mapplethorpe’s performing for his own self-portrait is stationed nearby. Jeff Koons, often considered Warhol’s heir, appears in the exhibition more frequently than anyone besides the master. One gets a sense of some of Mr. Koons’s range by seeing the porcelain and gold life-size statute “Michael Jackson and Bubbles,” as well as his stripped-down vacuums placed under fluorescent lights, reminiscent of the furniture displays he saw as a child in his father’s store. The sheer number of artists represented, however, means that most have only a single work included. Visitors can see Tom Sachs’s 1996 chainsaw composed of Chanel shopping bags, Damien Hirst’s “Medicine Cabinet” (1997-98), or a couple of magazine covers from the 1960s designed by Barbara Kruger. It’s a bit like an introductory course on Western civilization where multiple centuries are covered in a single lecture. The Met does at times note the debt that Warhol owes other artists. In the accompanying audio tour, for example, Alex Katz boasts that the flat background, square shape portraits and repeat images were his innovations. ”I just deal with appearances,” Mr. Katz says, explaining his flattened, affectless approach. “I like it empty.” You can stare at his bright 1964 painting of the art collector Lita Hornick just as Warhol did nearly 50 years ago, according to Mr. Katz, recalling that as he watched Warhol inspect the Hornick portrait, he suspected his contemporary was already planning his own version. Although Warhol was fond of asserting that he had no political ambitions, many artists used his methods to make political statements. Hans Haacke created a giant tribute to Warhol’s iconic red Marlboro cigarette pack but renamed it “Helmsboro” after the right-wing senator from North Carolina, Jesse Helms. Robert Gober created a wallpaper pattern out of two images: one of a sleeping man taken from a Bloomingdale’s ad and the other a lynching of a black man taken from a 1920s cartoon. An occasional nod is given to Warhol’s ventures into other media, like film. “Lonesome Cowboys,” his 1968 satire of the movie western, runs in a loop next to Kalup Linzy‘s 2006 broad farcical video, “As da Art World Might Turn.“ The final room is a recreation of Warhol’s 1966 show at the Leo Castelli Gallery: the walls are covered with fluorescent cow wallpaper while whirring fans, aided now and then by a hand from museum visitors, keep large helium-filled silver balloons aloft. The Met’s attempt at novelty has not been universally appreciated. In the eyes of The New York Times art critic Roberta Smith, it took an “impossibly unwieldy concept“ that despite its riches resulted in an “enthusiastic muddle.“ By contrast, Karen Rosenberg wrote in The Times about the Guggenheim Museum’s success in presenting a new look at Picasso. The museum’s decision to offer the first exhibition of Picasso’s black-and-white artwork might seem like “a glamorous gimmick,” but Ms. Rosenberg judged that this “stripped down and essentialized” view is “a refreshing change from the parade of shows about Picasso’s relationship with women” or “other artists.” What else distinguishes “Picasso Black and White,” which runs through Jan. 23, is the number of works — 38 — that have never previously been publicly displayed in the United States, like “Bust of a Woman With a Hat” (1939). Many people understandably associate Picasso’s monochromatic pictures with war, death and destruction. His greatest achievement in black and white is “Guernica,” a monumental memorial to the northern village in Spain that was brutally bombed by the Germans and Italians in 1937. That painting remains in the Museo Reina Sofia in Spain, but the Guggenheim is able to display three studies that Picasso did for it. This exhibition also contains “Charnel House” (1944-45), his depiction of a murdered family that evokes the piles of skeletal corpses at concentration camps. The purpose of bringing together so many black-and-whites, however, is to show that Picasso treated all sorts of subjects — eroticism, domestic scenes, homages to other painters — with that limited palette. His first large-scale work that uses only black and white is “The Milliner’s Workshop” (1926), a painting of the store across the street from his studio. Also displayed are Picasso’s interpretations of other masterworks like “The Maids of Honor (Las Meninas, after Velázquez)” (1957) and “The Rape of the Sabines” (1962), as well as voluptuous nudes and rapturous kisses. The audio guide maintains that the lack of color in his later work highlights the sexual content. Like Warhol, Picasso may have been influenced by the black-and-white newspapers, newsreels and photographs that characterized much of the media from the last century. Other inspirations also abounded, said Carmen Giménez, a curator of the Guggenheim’s show. The artist’s use of black and white owes something to ancient cave paintings, to the tradition of tonal painting known as grisaille, to Picasso’s interest in classical sculpture and to his own Spanish heritage and artists like El Greco, Velázquez, and Goya, who worked in black. As the Metropolitan’s exhibition notes, Warhol divorced image from color. The Guggenheim’s meditation on Picasso’s monochromatic paintings shows that he did so as well, though it emphasizes that Picasso eschewed color in order to focus on form, structure and space. “You capture more of the reality of a picture in black and white,” says his daughter, Maya Widmaier-Picasso. Whereas Delacroix luxuriated in color, saying that “gray is the enemy of painting,” Picasso, whose treatment of Delacroix’s “The Women of Algiers” (1955) is in black and white, maintained that “color weakens.” The weight of a thousand previous exhibitions did not weigh on curators at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, despite their hosting the work of Ai Weiwei, who has been described as “possibly the world’s most famous living artist.” Their coup this season was to land the first American show dedicated to Mr. Ai, the Chinese artist and activist. Their challenge was to keep his celebrated political achievements from overshadowing his artistic endeavors. Ms. Smith of The Times is skeptical that the show, which runs through Feb. 24, succeeds in this respect. Mr. Ai is probably best known for helping design the Olympic stadium in Beijing, Bird’s Nest, and for demanding an official inquiry into the deaths of thousands of children during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, when hundreds of poorly constructed schools collapsed. In the Hirshhorn’s show, “Ai Weiwei: According to What?” the art is frequently “overshadowed by the celebrity, pronouncements and predicaments of the artist himself,” Ms. Smith writes in her review, suggesting that Mr. Ai “doesn’t make great art as much as make great use — amplified by digital technology — of the role of the artist as public intellectual and social conscience.” The exhibition, which will be reprised at the Brooklyn Museum in 2014, features sculptures and installations, including an enormous snake made out of children’s backpacks that slithers along the galleries’ ceiling and “Kippe,” an agglomeration of wood pieces from Qing dynasty temples. Included in the exhibition are ancient Chinese pots painted in bright neon colors or imprinted with a Coca-Cola logo. (A similar piece by Mr. Ai is in the Met’s Warhol show.) “He Xie,” a creeping mass of red and brown ceramic crabs, refers to a 2010 dinner of river crabs held to honor Mr. Ai’s Shanghai studio before government authorities had it destroyed. (Another 2,500-crab version of “He Xie” is on display at the Mary Boone Gallery in New York.) Mr. Ai, who has been beaten and imprisoned for his outspokenness, has not been able to attend the show or fulfill any of his other international lecture and teaching commitments scheduled for this fall. He has been forbidden to leave China, speak to foreign journalists or use Twitter. Picasso, Warhol and Benton did not suffer the same type of persecution as Mr. Ai has, but as some of their work — and that of their contemporaries — on display this season shows, the line between art and politics is frequently blurred. Trying to figure out where it might lie is one of the puzzles and joys of looking.    \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The internet is a technology of low-cost communication and connection. Everything from email to e-commerce to social networks has hinged on the internet’s transformative role in changing the economics of communication. All those connections suddenly became both possible and cheap. Artificial intelligence is a technology of low-cost prediction and discovery. It exploits the new resource of the digital age — vast amounts of data — to identify patterns and make predictions. Much of what A.I. does today can be thought of as a prediction. What product to recommend, what ad to show you, what image is in that picture, what move should the robot make next — all are automated predictions. This concept of A.I. as an engine of predictive decision-making is the main theme of a new book by three economists at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, “Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of Artificial Intelligence” (Harvard Business Review Press). The authors, Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans and Avi Goldfarb, argue that A.I.-powered decision-making is poised to alter virtually every industry. To explain, they start with an A.I. leader, Amazon. The online retail giant is constantly learning more and more about its customers’ buying habits and tastes, and the data is steadily improving the predictive power of its A.I. algorithms. Imagine, the authors suggest, that Amazon’s A.I. gets good enough that the company takes the next step — shipping goods before they are ordered. It knows what you want so accurately that returns would be minimal and make Amazon even more efficient. It would also change the nature of shopping “from an opt-in experience to an opt-out experience,” Mr. Agrawal said in an interview. A fanciful thought experiment? Perhaps. But Amazon was granted a patent for “anticipatory shipping” in 2013. Just where artificial intelligence is taking us, at what pace and along what trajectory, is uncertain. The technology, of course, is raising serious questions about its potential impact on jobs, privacy and politics. Still, A.I. is marching into practically every field, from agriculture to the arts. Here are five examples: MEDICINE Brendan Frey studied under Geoffrey Hinton, a scientist and pioneer of so-called deep learning, an A.I. technique that has made remarkable progress in recent years on tasks like image recognition and language translation. For years, Mr. Frey has done research that combines deep-learning and cell biology. Deep Genomics, founded in 2015, is at the forefront of efforts by big companies, start-ups and university researchers to transform the economics of drug discovery. The problem is apparent. It typically takes several years and costs billions of dollars for pharmaceutical companies to bring a new drug to market. Much of the money and time is spent on clinical trials on human subjects. A.I. holds the promise of sharply reducing the amount of costly and lengthy trial and error in traditional drug development and testing. Deep Genomics, based in Toronto, is not only using its technology to winnow the number of target compounds to attack a particular disease, but also to predict the biological outcome in humans. “The guesswork is tremendously reduced,” Mr. Frey said. It is still early for Deep Genomics and its approach. The first of its compounds will be tested in clinical trials beginning in 2020. AGRICULTURE Corporate agriculture deploys an array of high-tech tools including sophisticated weather modeling, soil sensors, genetic seed breeding and drones. But there is another side to agriculture: the 500 million small farms — two hectares or less — that produce most of the developing world’s food. PlantVillage, a research and development project, based at Penn State University, is beginning to bring artificial intelligence to these smaller farms. Scientists at PlantVillage, in collaboration with international organizations, local farm extension programs and engineers at Google, is working to tailor A.I. technology for farmers in Tanzania who have inexpensive smartphones. The initial focus is on cassava, a hearty crop that can survive droughts and barren soil. But plant disease and pests can reduce crop yields by 40 percent or more. PlantVillage and International Institute of Tropical Agriculture have developed a simple A.I. assistant, called Nuru (“light” in Swahili). Wave the phone over a plant leaf, and the software diagnoses the disease or pest blight and suggests low-tech treatments. Once downloaded, the app does not require wireless access to cellular data or remote computing power, which means it works in rural villages. Programs in Kenya and India are underway. In the developed nations, people fear A.I. as a job killer. “But in low-income countries that lack human capital in fields like agricultural science, there is an opportunity to use A.I. to help break the cycle of poverty,” said David Hughes, an entomologist at Penn State and the director of PlantVillage. HEAVY EQUIPMENT An estimated billion people in more than 60 countries step onto a KONE elevator or escalator every day. Its big people-lifting machines are a representative example of the A.I. overhaul underway in businesses that make and service heavy equipment. The Finland-based multinational is using IBM’s Watson software to constantly monitor the performance of its machines. Low-cost sensors, wireless communications, cloud computing and A.I. software are the technical ingredients that make the change possible now. KONE’s new equipment is being made with the sensors and wireless links, while its older models are being retrofitted. Data streams off each machine, every second, providing measurements that include vibration, leveling, braking, temperature, door openings and cargo weight. The data is fed into the A.I. software, which looks for telltale signals that a machine is in need of maintenance or a new part, before it fails. “You go from being reactive to proactive and predictive,” said Larry Wash, an executive vice president of KONE. The results on the elevators deploying the new technology so far are encouraging. There are 25 percent fewer breakdowns and 60 percent fewer customer reports of problems than on elevators serviced on traditional maintenance schedules. INSURANCE Root Insurance, a start-up in Columbus, Ohio, is using artificial intelligence to more accurately price car insurance. Alex Timm, the chief executive, says good drivers pay more than they should, effectively subsidizing the bad-driving culprits — the one third drivers responsible for the majority of accidents. Root is a bet that with modern technology, it can do better, charging good drivers less for auto insurance, up to $100 a month less — and the start-up can still be quite profitable. Since its insurance app was introduced in the fall of 2016, Root has expanded into 20 states to date. Root uses the sensors in a smartphone to measure location, acceleration, braking and turning. The myriad sensor data is parsed by clever software for signals of risky driving behavior — lane changing, tail gating, even texting (typing generates tiny, but measurable, vibrations). Potential customers download the Root app and are monitored for a test-drive period, typically two or three weeks. The algorithmically-vetted safe drivers are approved. “Our models are much more accurately predictive of accidents,” Mr. Timm said. Root insists that it collects data only for its own risk analysis. “We’ve never sold data and never will,” he said. ART In 2015, weirdly morphing images of puppies and celebrity faces appeared in YouTube videos. They immediately became a sensation in the digital art world. Not only was the hallucinogenic imagery remarkable, but it was also the handiwork of Google’s Deep Dream, an A.I. program. Deep Dream used so-called neural networks to digest millions of images, identify visual patterns and then create something new — a kind of aesthetic prediction. Today, many computer artists are using A.I. tools to create new imagery, design interactive visual experiences and probe machine intelligence. Their work benefits from a wealth of A.I. software that is freely shared among computer scientists and artists. In his project “Experiments with Deep Generator Networks,” Gene Kogan used a machine-learning algorithm that learned from many photos on the web, which were labeled in categories like gazebo or butte, and then produced its own version. “It’s a neural network imagining what a gazebo or butte looks like,” said Mr. Kogan, a resident scholar at New York University. Computer art has been around for decades, and Hollywood’s digitally animated movies and special effects are marvels of rich, evocative imagery. But that is more comparable to computer-aided design, with the software serving as a supercharged pencil or paintbrush, still firmly controlled by the human artists. Modern A.I. software is different. “Now, we’re playing with tools that, maybe, — are more akin to human perception and intelligence,” said Golan Levin, a professor of electronic art at Carnegie Mellon University.    \n",

                                                                                                             MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — In a top-secret lab in an undisclosed Bay Area location where robots run free, the future is being imagined. It’s a place where your refrigerator could be connected to the Internet, so it could order groceries when they ran low. Your dinner plate could post to a social network what you’re eating. Your robot could go to the office while you stay home in your pajamas. And you could, perhaps, take an elevator to outer space. These are just a few of the dreams being chased at Google X, the clandestine lab where Google is tackling a list of 100 shoot-for-the-stars ideas. In interviews, a dozen people discussed the list; some work at the lab or elsewhere at Google, and some have been briefed on the project. But none would speak for attribution because Google is so secretive about the effort that many employees do not even know the lab exists. Although most of the ideas on the list are in the conceptual stage, nowhere near reality, two people briefed on the project said one product would be released by the end of the year, although they would not say what it was. “They’re pretty far out in front right now,” said Rodney Brooks, a professor emeritus at M.I.T.’s computer science and artificial intelligence lab and founder of Heartland Robotics. “But Google’s not an ordinary company, so almost nothing applies.” At most Silicon Valley companies, innovation means developing online apps or ads, but Google sees itself as different. Even as Google has grown into a major corporation and tech start-ups are biting at its heels, the lab reflects its ambition to be a place where ground-breaking research and development are happening, in the tradition of Xerox PARC, which developed the modern personal computer in the 1970s. A Google spokeswoman, Jill Hazelbaker, declined to comment on the lab, but said that investing in speculative projects was an important part of Google’s DNA. “While the possibilities are incredibly exciting, please do keep in mind that the sums involved are very small by comparison to the investments we make in our core businesses,” she said. At Google, which uses artificial intelligence techniques and machine learning in its search algorithm, some of the outlandish projects may not be as much of a stretch as they first appear, even though they defy the bounds of the company’s main Web search business. For example, space elevators, a longtime fantasy of Google’s founders and other Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, could collect information or haul things into space. (In theory, they involve rocketless space travel along a cable anchored to Earth.) “Google is collecting the world’s data, so now it could be collecting the solar system’s data,” Mr. Brooks said. Sergey Brin, Google’s co-founder, is deeply involved in the lab, said several people with knowledge of it, and came up with the list of ideas along with Larry Page, Google’s other founder, who worked on Google X before becoming chief executive in April; Eric E. Schmidt, its chairman; and other top executives. “Where I spend my time is farther afield projects, which we hope will graduate to important key businesses in the future,” Mr. Brin said recently, though he did not mention Google X. Google may turn one of the ideas — the driverless cars that it unleashed on California’s roads last year — into a new business. Unimpressed by the innovative spirit of Detroit automakers, Google now is considering manufacturing them in the United States, said a person briefed on the effort. Google could sell navigation or information technology for the cars, and theoretically could show location-based ads to passengers as they zoom by local businesses while playing Angry Birds in the driver’s seat. Robots figure prominently in many of the ideas. They have long captured the imagination of Google engineers, including Mr. Brin, who has already attended a conference through robot instead of in the flesh. Fleets of robots could assist Google with collecting information, replacing the humans that photograph streets for Google Maps, say people with knowledge of Google X. Robots born in the lab could be destined for homes and offices, where they could assist with mundane tasks or allow people to work remotely, they say. Other ideas involve what Google referred to as the “Web of things” at its software developers conference in May — a way of connecting objects to the Internet. Every time anyone uses the Web, it benefits Google, the company argued, so it could be good for Google if home accessories and wearable objects, not just computers, were connected. Among the items that could be connected: a garden planter (so it could be watered from afar); a coffee pot (so it could be set to brew remotely); or a light bulb (so it could be turned off remotely). Google said in May that by the end of this year another team planned to introduce a Web-connected light bulb that could communicate wirelessly with Android devices. One Google engineer familiar with Google X said it was run as mysteriously as the C.I.A. — with two offices, a nondescript one for logistics, on the company’s Mountain View campus, and one for robots, in a secret location. While software engineers toil away elsewhere at Google, the lab is filled with roboticists and electrical engineers. They have been hired from Microsoft, Nokia Labs, Stanford, M.I.T., Carnegie Mellon and New York University. A leader at Google X is Sebastian Thrun, one of the world’s top robotics and artificial intelligence experts, who teaches computer science at Stanford and has developed a driverless car. Also at the lab is Andrew Ng, another Stanford professor, who specializes in applying neuroscience to artificial intelligence to teach robots and machines to operate like people. Johnny Chung Lee, a specialist in human-computer interaction, came to Google X from Microsoft this year after helping develop Microsoft’s Kinect, the video game player that responds to human movement and voice. At Google X, where he is working on the Web of things, according to people familiar with his role, he has the mysterious title of rapid evaluator. Because Google X is a breeding ground for big bets that could turn into colossal failures or Google’s next big business — and it could take years to figure out which — just the idea of these experiments terrifies some shareholders and analysts. “These moon-shot projects are a very Google-y thing for them to do,” said Colin W. Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners. “People don’t love it but they tolerate it because their core search business is firing away.” Mr. Page has tried to appease analysts by saying that crazy projects are a tiny proportion of Google’s work. “There are a few small, speculative projects happening at any one time, but we are very careful stewards of shareholders’ money,” he told analysts in July. “We are not betting the farm on these.”    \n",
