       "      <td>LOS ANGELES – Back in 2008, Gears of War 2 introduced Horde mode, a co-operative way to play that saw five friends holing up and fending off wave after wave of hideous creatures. When it launches next year, Gears of War 3 will add a new Beast multiplayer mode that lets you and your friends get inside those marauding monsters. I played a few rounds of the promising five-player Beast co-op during a hands-on E3 event here Thursday. We spawned on a map called Mercy, a church where Marcus and his COG buddies attempt to make a final stand. Our mission was to spawn as a variety of deadly creatures and attempt to off the computer-controlled humans. The meatbags aren't exactly helpless – they're armed with the standard COG loadout, and they've also got mounted turrets, barbed wire and laser fences to keep the beasts from running roughshod over them. I started by spawning as the smallest monster – a Ticker. I steered the small, fast-moving suicide bug around the human barricades and self-destructed at the feet of two human gunners. That was two down and many more smoldering splatters of flesh and blood to go. Beast mode is still being tweaked, Gears of War 3's Rod Ferguson told me. When the game ships, players will have to earn the ability to spawn as bigger, meaner monsters by getting kills and causing damage. For the demo, we had free reign to spawn as almost anything we wanted. In this early stage, the creatures were split into four categories. Beasts are nasty little creatures like the Ticker and a new, slithering insectoid called a Serapede. (As this critter, I squirmed around the feet of humans, clamping their legs between my electrically charged tentacles. I racked up more kills as this monster than as any other.) Other categories will be familiar to anybody who has played Gears of War. Within the Humanoid and Drone categories, players can opt to spawn as a gun-wielding locust or play as a Kantus healer. Big beasts like the Boomers prove a real hoot to play. One of the behemoths totes a new gun called The Digger that launches burrowing missiles underground and beneath cover. A Mauler, with its giant flail, can smash human barbed-wire fences with a single swing. Destroying humans isn't as easy as it sounds, though. More than a few times, the A.I. defenders ran out the clock, surviving our attack and forcing us to replay the wave and slaughter more efficiently. Even in this early state, it's easy to tell that Beast mode will be as appealing to co-op gamers as Horde – which, I might add, is being refined and tweaked for Gears of War 3 as well. Gears of War 3 comes out April 2011 for the Xbox 360. Image courtesy Microsoft See Also:</td>\n",

       "      <td>In the age of the internet, it’s easier than ever to pull together lots of information to find the best doctor. And if you’re like most patients, the metric you probably rely on most is the doctor’s credentials. Where did she go to school? How many patients has he treated with this condition? You might also read some Yelp reviews about how nice this doctor is; how friendly and how caring. But all that probably seems secondary to the doctor’s skills; sure, it would be great to have a doctor whom you actually like, but that’s not going to influence your health the way the doctor’s competence will. But our research in the psychology department at Stanford University suggests that this view is mistaken. We found that having a doctor who is warm and reassuring actually improves your health. The simple things a doctor says and does to connect with patients can make a difference for health outcomes. Even a brief reassurance to a patient from a doctor might relieve the patient’s symptoms faster. In a recent study that one of us conducted, our research group recruited 76 participants to receive a skin prick test, a common procedure used in assessing allergies. The provider in this study pricked participants’ forearms with histamine, which makes skin itchy and red. Then, the doctor examined the allergic reactions. For some patients, the doctor examined them without saying much. But for other patients, the doctor had some words of encouragement. He told them: “From this point forward, your allergic reaction will start to diminish, and your rash and irritation will go away.” It turns out that this one sentence of assurance from a provider led patients to report that their reactions were less itchy — even though the doctor didn’t give any medication or treatment along with his words. Words alone from the provider relieved patients’ symptoms. This tells us that a physician’s words might be more powerful than we normally realize. And research shows that it is not only when patients are taking placebos that demeanor matters. In fact, provider words influence the efficacy of even our most powerful drugs and treatments. But as anyone who has been on the receiving end of a terse “You’re fine” knows, it’s not just what you say, it’s how you say it. In another study one of us worked on, we assessed whether the same words from a doctor influence patients differently depending on how warm or competent the doctor seemed. Again, patients received a histamine skin prick. Depending on what experimental group they were assigned to, patients met a provider trained to act in one of two very different ways. One group met the provider many of us dream of: she acted both warm and competent, calling patients by name, smiling, chatting and making eye contact. Her office was spotless, she spoke clearly and confidently, and she pulled off the medical procedures without a hitch. The other group, however, met the kind of doctor all too many of us have encountered: glued to the computer screen throughout the exam, the provider didn’t bother introducing herself and asked questions only to gather practical information. She also stumbled through some of the procedures in the messy exam room and sounded rather unsure of herself. In both groups, the provider gave patients a cream that she said was an antihistamine to reduce the allergic reaction and decrease itching. The cream was merely unscented hand lotion: a placebo. (A benefit of doing this research in the lab is that for the purposes of the study, we can temporarily lead patients to believe something that is untrue, something doctors could never do in a real clinic visit.) Decades of robust literature on placebo effects demonstrate that, even without any active ingredients, this cream should reduce the allergic reaction. But no one had examined how the doctor’s demeanor might influence the effects of a placebo treatment. Our study revealed that the placebo cream reduced participants’ allergic reactions only when the provider projected warmth and competence. When the provider acted colder and less competent, the placebo cream had no effect. It seems that it’s not just what the doctor says about a treatment that matters. It matters how the doctor who says it engages with patients. Doctors who are warmer and more competent are able to set more powerful expectations about medical treatments. Those positive expectations, in turn, have a measurable impact on health. So, we saw that when the provider projected both desirable qualities of warmth and competence, her words had an effect. When she projected neither, they did not. What about a provider who seems competent, but not warm? One other group of patients met a provider who seemed highly competent but remained businesslike and distant throughout the interaction, and they did not respond to the placebo cream as much as when the provider acted warm and competent. Patients of even the most accomplished and skillful doctors may benefit more when that doctor also connects with them. All of this research suggests that doctors who don’t connect with their patients may risk undermining a treatment’s success. Doctor-patient rapport is not just a fluffy, feel-good bonus that boosts Yelp reviews, but a component of medical care that has important effects on a patient’s physical health. Particularly as artificial intelligence promises a world where we don’t need to go to the doctor for minor questions, we should not overlook the value of interacting with a human doctor and hearing words of encouragement. And while physicians may worry that building rapport with patients requires too much time in a health care setting with visits that are already too short, there are simple ways to build warmth and competence — such as smiling, looking patients in the eye and asking their names — that don’t tax doctors beyond their limits. We often think the only parts of medical care that really matter are the “active” ingredients of medicine: the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. But focusing only on these ingredients leaves important components of care underappreciated and underutilized. To really help people flourish, health care works better when it includes caring.

       "      <td>WASHINGTON — The Biden administration and its allies are assembling a punishing set of financial, technology and military sanctions against Russia that they say would go into effect within hours of an invasion of Ukraine, hoping to make clear to President Vladimir V. Putin the high cost he would pay if he sends troops across the border. In interviews, officials described details of those plans for the first time, just ahead of a series of diplomatic negotiations to defuse the crisis with Moscow, one of the most perilous moments in Europe since the end of the Cold War. The talks begin on Monday in Geneva and then move across Europe. The plans the United States has discussed with allies in recent days include cutting off Russia’s largest financial institutions from global transactions, imposing an embargo on American-made or American-designed technology needed for defense-related and consumer industries, and arming insurgents in Ukraine who would conduct what would amount to a guerrilla war against a Russian military occupation, if it comes to that. Such moves are rarely telegraphed in advance. But with the negotiations looming — and the fate of Europe’s post-Cold War borders and NATO’s military presence on the continent at stake — President Biden’s advisers say they are trying to signal to Mr. Putin exactly what he would face, at home and abroad, in hopes of influencing his decisions in coming weeks. The talks on Monday will be led by the deputy secretary of state, Wendy R. Sherman, an experienced diplomat who negotiated the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran. Russian officials are expected to press their demands for “security guarantees,” including prohibiting the deployment of any missiles in Europe that could strike Russia and the placement of weaponry or troops in former Soviet states that joined NATO after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Mr. Putin is also demanding an end to NATO expansion, including a promise that Ukraine could never join the nuclear alliance. While the Biden administration has said it is willing to discuss all Russian security concerns — and has a long list of its own — the demands amount to a dismantling of the security architecture of Europe built after the Soviet Union’s collapse. On Wednesday, members of the NATO alliance will meet with Russia in Brussels. The next day in Vienna, Ukrainian officials will also be at the table, for the first time, for talks at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. But with 57 members, that group is so large that few expect serious negotiations. American diplomats worry that after the whirlwind week, the Russians could declare that their security concerns are not being met — and use the failure of talks as a justification for military action. “No one should be surprised if Russia instigates a provocation or incident,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Friday, and “then tries to use it to justify military intervention, hoping that by the time the world realizes the ruse, it’ll be too late.” This time, he said, “we’ve been clear with Russia about what it will face if it continues on this path, including economic measures that we haven’t used before — massive consequences.” That warning, however, is an unspoken acknowledgment that the Obama administration’s response in 2014, when Mr. Putin last invaded parts of Ukraine, was too tentative and mild. At that time, Mr. Putin surprised the world by annexing Crimea and fueling a grinding proxy war in eastern Ukraine. Now, American officials say they are trying to learn from their past mistakes. An internal review of those actions, conducted by the White House in recent weeks, concluded that while Obama-era sanctions damaged Russia’s economy and led to a sell-off of its currency, they failed at their central strategic objective: to cause so much pain that Mr. Putin would be forced to withdraw. Nearly eight years later, Russia still holds Crimea and has ignored most of the diplomatic commitments it made in the negotiations that followed, known as the Minsk accords. Those sanctions started with actions against some smaller Russian banks and individuals directly involved in the invasion. Virtually all of the sanctions — and additional measures imposed after Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and after the SolarWinds cyberattack in 2020 that sabotaged computer programs used by the federal government and American companies — remain in place. But there is scant evidence that they have deterred Mr. Putin, who began building up forces near the Ukrainian border just as Mr. Biden announced his response to SolarWinds last spring. When asked recently whether he could point to any evidence that the Russians were deterred by recent sanctions, a senior aide to Mr. Biden paused a moment and then said, “No, none.” Rather than start with moves against small banks and on-the-ground military commanders, officials said, the new sanctions would be directed at cutting off the largest Russian financial institutions that depend on global financial transfers. The plan was described by one official as a “high-impact, quick-action response that we did not pursue in 2014.” The officials declined to say whether the United States was prepared to cut Russia off from the SWIFT system, which executes global financial transactions between more than 1,100 banks in 200 countries. But European officials say they have discussed that possibility — something most major European powers had declined to consider until recently, for fear that Russia might retaliate by attempting to cut off gas and oil flows in the winter, even briefly. The SWIFT cutoff has been used against Iran with some success. But Cynthia Roberts, a professor of political science at Hunter College, noted that Russia had learned a lot about “global sanctions-proofing,” and she expressed doubt that the country would suffer as much as American officials contend if it were disconnected from SWIFT. “They would definitely take a big hit,” she said at a seminar held this past week by the Center for the National Interest. But she noted that Russia had stockpiled hundreds of billions in gold and dollar reserves and that the Bank of China had joined Russia’s own domestic version of SWIFT. That raises the possibility that Russia and China, as part of their expanding partnership, might join forces to help Moscow evade the West’s action. The bottom line, she said, is that “sanctions have a very poor coercive track record.” The technology sanctions would target some of Mr. Putin’s favored industries — particularly aerospace and arms, which are major producers of revenue for the Russian government. The focus would be on Russian-built fighter aircraft, antiaircraft systems, antisatellite systems, space systems and emerging technologies where Russia is hoping to make gains, like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Similar export controls have been surprisingly effective against China’s leading producer of cellphones, Huawei, which for a while was among the top providers of smartphones to the world. That part of its business has all but collapsed in the past year because it cannot obtain advanced chips. But the Russian economy bears little resemblance to China’s, and it is not clear that it is equally vulnerable to an embargo of semiconductors and other microelectronics that are critical to Chinese manufacturing. There are other options under consideration that go well beyond merely banning the sale of computer chips. In one additional step, according to American officials, the Commerce Department could issue a ruling that would essentially ban the export of any consumer goods to Russia — from cellphones and laptop computers to refrigerators and washing machines — that contain American-made or American-designed electronics. That would apply not only to American makers, but also to European, South Korean and other foreign manufacturers that use American chips or software. Unlike China, Russia does not make many of these products — and the effects on consumers could be broad. But a senior European official said there was still a debate about whether the Russian people would blame Mr. Putin, or the United States and its allies, for their inability to buy the goods. While the Commerce and Treasury Departments work on sanctions that would maximize America’s advantages over Russia, the Pentagon is developing plans that have echoes of the proxy wars of the 1960s and ’70s. To underscore the potential pain for Russia, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark A. Milley, spoke with his Russian counterpart two weeks ago and delivered a stark message: Yes, he said, you could invade Ukraine and probably roll over the Ukrainian military, which stands little chance of repelling a far larger, better armed Russian force. But the swift victory would be followed, General Milley told Gen. Valery Gerasimov, by a bloody insurgency, similar to the one that led to the Soviet retreat from Afghanistan more than three decades ago, according to officials familiar with the discussion. General Milley did not detail to General Gerasimov the planning underway in Washington to support an insurgency, a so-called “porcupine strategy” to make invading Ukraine hard for the Russians to swallow. That includes the advance positioning of arms for Ukrainian insurgents, probably including Stinger antiaircraft missiles, that could be used against Russian forces. More than a month ago, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, created a new interagency planning cell to examine a range of contingencies if Mr. Putin goes ahead with an invasion. The cell, which reports directly to Mr. Sullivan, includes representatives from the National Security Council, the intelligence agencies and the Departments of Defense, State, Treasury, Energy and Homeland Security. The cell is attempting to tailor responses to the many types of attacks that could unfold in the next few weeks, from cyberattacks aimed at crippling Ukraine’s electric grid and pipelines to the seizure of small or large amounts of territory. Intelligence officials said recently that they thought the least likely possibility was a full-scale invasion in which the Russians try to take the capital, Kyiv. Many of the assessments, however, have explored more incremental moves by Mr. Putin, which could include seizing a bit more land in the Donbas region, where war has ground into a stalemate, or a land bridge to Crimea. Several officials familiar with the planning say the administration is looking at European nations that could provide more aid to support Ukrainian forces before any conflict, as well as in the initial stages of a Russian invasion. Lt. Col. Anton Semelroth, a Defense Department spokesman, noted in December that the United States had already committed over $2.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since 2014, including $450 million in 2021 alone. Over the past three months, it has delivered 180 Javelin missiles, two patrol boats, ammunition for grenade launchers, machine guns, secure radios, medical equipment and other items that U.S. officials describe as defensive in nature. But the planning cell is considering more lethal weaponry, such as antiaircraft weapons. After visiting Ukraine last month, Representative Seth Moulton, Democrat of Massachusetts and a former Marine officer, said that in his view, “We need to make any incursion by Russia more painful — Day 1 painful, not six months from now painful.” “We have a short window to take decisive action to deter Putin from a serious invasion,” Mr. Moulton said in an interview. “I worry our current deterrent tactics are responding to an invasion rather than preventing it.” One option likely to be discussed at NATO this coming week is a plan to increase, possibly by several thousand, the number of troops stationed in the Baltics and in Southeast Europe. On Friday, Mr. Blinken again warned that if the Russians invade, NATO would deploy more forces along the borders between NATO nations and Russian-controlled territory.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Last week, Wikipedia received an unusual prompt. For one thing, it dealt with sensitive subject matter. And it didn’t come from a person — it came from YouTube, the largest video site on the internet. During an interview at South by Southwest in Austin, Tex., YouTube’s chief executive, Susan Wojcicki, announced that the company she leads would enlist Wikipedia’s help to deal with the proliferation of conspiracy theories and misinformation on its platform. The plan was presented as just one of many ways that YouTube, which is owned by Google, would address mounting concerns about its content. But it highlighted a jarring dynamic: Here was Google, a company with revenue in excess of $100 billion last year, calling on a volunteer-built, donation-funded nonprofit organization to help it solve a crisis. Specifically, Ms. Wojcicki said, YouTube would soon begin experimenting with what it called “information cues” sourced from the online encyclopedia. The cues would appear as captions and article links beneath videos that dealt with topics related to popular conspiracy theories — she used the moon landing and “chemtrails” as examples. Her interviewer, Nicholas Thompson of Wired Magazine, gently teased, “So, YouTube will be sending people to text?” Away from the conference stage, the responses were anything but gentle. “I’m genuinely curious whether YouTube management is a bunch of Pollyannas who have never watched the videos on their platforms, or a bunch of people who just don’t care,” Renee DiResta, a researcher and expert in online disinformation, tweeted. Justin Brookman, the director for consumer privacy and technology policy at Consumers Union, called the plan “a disingenuous cop-out that will make Wikipedia’s job harder.” Others noted what seemed like an obvious point: Can’t anyone edit Wikipedia, including the conspiracy theorists themselves? From the Wikimedia Foundation, which oversees Wikipedia, the first response was confusion. YouTube is doing what? Katherine Maher, the executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation, sounded as if she wouldn’t have minded a heads up. “When the announcement came out, we were surprised that we hadn’t been contacted,” Ms. Maher said in an interview. She had learned about YouTube’s plans at the same time as everyone else — including Wikipedia’s army of volunteer contributors, some of whom were not pleased with the idea that an internet colossus had casually declared that it would outsource one of its knottiest problems to a relatively small nonprofit organization. “Wikipedia is not something that just exists,” Ms. Maher said. “It takes work and it requires labor.” A Wikipedia editor who goes by the handle SEMMENDINGER shared a concern on a contributor discussion page, writing, “My worry is that the people viewing these sorts of videos in the first place are the same people who wholeheartedly are in agreement with the content.” Another editor, Doc James, was more sanguine. “I do not imagine many problems,” he said. “We have lots of policies to help support those who come with good references and rebuff those without.” YouTube’s announcement might be chalked up to an unintentional miscommunication or a public relations misstep. But for Wikipedia, it was part of a familiar pattern. A cross between a piece of infrastructure, a public commons and an online community, Wikipedia has been a boon to some of the largest companies in the world since it started nearly two decades ago. Whatever benefit Google hopes to get from using the online encyclopedia to fact-check YouTube videos is likely to pale in comparison with the value it receives from including Wikipedia entries in its search results. Google’s “Knowledge Graph,” which displays certain answers to search queries in separate, authoritative-looking boxes on the right side of a computer screen, draws heavily from Wikipedia. Furthermore, virtually every voice assistant, including Amazon’s Echo and Apple’s Siri, uses the site to give customers a wide range of answers to their questions. Wikipedia has also proved invaluable to tech companies as they develop artificial intelligence and translation services — as a multilanguage corpus for researchers, it is unparalleled (and, of course, free). “The degree to which the Wikipedia data has informed computer science is pretty astonishing,” said Brent Hecht, an assistant professor at Northwestern University who has studied Wikipedia’s relationships with tech companies and online communities. “Wikipedia definitely creates massively more value for these companies than they put in.” With the YouTube announcement, Wikipedia finds itself in a predicament similar to that of a small town after it has been chosen as the site of a new Walmart: Some municipalities have said that the retail giant creates undue stress on local police forces, straining them to the breaking point with endless calls to deal with petty crimes at the super stores. Wikipedia’s lopsided relationships can also amplify pre-existing internal problems. Its contributors skew white and male, for example, leading to predictable outcomes — just 17 percent of the subjects of biographies on the site are women. Wikipedia is taking steps to address the issue, but the next generation of consumer tech is being built on top of it — and its gaps and biases — in the meantime. Having come of age in the era of desktop and laptop computers, Wikipedia is also struggling to bring itself into the smartphone era (not to mention whatever comes next). “If we have interfaces like Alexa, for example, they’re using infrastructure and content generated by editors, but they’re not really encouraging readers to contribute in any way,” said Dariusz Jemielniak, who published a book-length ethnographic study of Wikipedia and now sits on the Wikimedia Foundation’s board. “They might not even realize it’s coming from Wikipedia,” he added. “It would be nice if people who take also give a little bit.” The main problem with YouTube’s presumptuous announcement, Mr. Jemielniak suggested, is that Wikipedia is not necessarily geared toward breaking news — and conspiracy theories tend to move at lightning speed during times of crisis. Recently, for instance, YouTube was rife with conspiracy videos about the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., and it is unclear what even a thorough and well-sourced Wikipedia article could have done to dissuade an audience intent on believing that students at the school were paid “crisis actors” carrying out orders. More to the point, Mr. Jemielniak said, if Google wanted help from Wikipedia, it could have asked. Ms. Maher agreed. At the very least, she said, it would be nice to have “a primary point of contact” at Google and companies like it — “someone who is invested in thinking of us an entity rather than just a resource.” As it stands, no such person has that role — though YouTube has reached out to the foundation since the announcement, and the two organizations are regularly in touch in less formal ways. (Google declined to comment for this article. Ms. Maher said of their interaction this week, “It was good for a start.”) Then there’s the issue of money. As important as Wikipedia may be to some of the richest companies in the world, it is, in financial terms, comparatively minuscule, with a yearly budget of less than $100 million — a rounding error for big tech. (It should be noted that Google has made one-off contributions to Wikipedia in the past and includes the Wikimedia Foundation in a program through which it matches employee donations, which netted the foundation around $1 million last year.) For now, Wikipedians — among the most central and least visible participants in this conversation — seem not overly perturbed. “Looks like we have more work to do,” wrote one, after the YouTube announcement. “I doubt that much will change anytime soon.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>I have good news and bad news for you. Let’s start with the bad: a concept I call Depressing Math. Check this out: That’s one box for every week of a 90-year life. It often feels like we have countless weeks ahead of us. But actually, it’s just a few thousand — a small-enough number to fit neatly in a single image. Once you visualize the human life span, it becomes clear that so many parts of life we think of as “countless” are in fact quite countable. I love going to the American Museum of Natural History, and I’ve been three times since I moved to New York in 2009. If that rate continues, I’ll step into the museum 12 more times. For an activity I think of as “something I like to do,” that number seems shockingly low. I also love going to the movies, but ever since it became effortless to stream everything at home, I’ve been averaging one or two movie theater trips a year. In my head, I’ll go out for hundreds more movies in my life, but the real amount is probably some weirdly small number like 53. Depressing Math is especially depressing when you’re living through a pandemic. Covid hasn’t taken away our weeks, but it has robbed us of our favorite activities — experiences that are already in short supply. But perhaps the hardest math to process — and, in turn, the hardest Covid pill to swallow — has to do with our relationships. I grew up spending some time with my parents almost every day. Since turning 19 and moving away for good, I’ve averaged about 10 to 15 days a year with them. If I’m one of the lucky ones, I’ll have quality time with my parents until I’m 60. That means that the day I headed off to college, I had something like 350 remaining parent days total — the amount of time I had with them every year of my childhood. What it boils down to is this: My life, in the best-case scenario, will consist of around 20 years of in-person parent time. The first 19 happened over the course of my first 19 years. The final year is spread out over the rest of my life. When I left for college, I had many decades left with living parents, but only about one year of time left to spend with them. It’s the same story with childhood friends. I spent high school sitting around with the same four friends, notching somewhere around 1,000 hangouts by the time we scattered off to different cities. Since then, our text thread keeps us in touch, but we’ve only managed to get the whole group together for a weekend every few years — about 10 total days each decade. It feels like we’re smack in the middle of our lives together, but like me and my parents, the high school group is currently enjoying its final 5 percent of in-person time together. Depressing Math reveals a cold truth: While you may not be anywhere near the end of your life, you may very well be nearing the end of your time spent with some of the most important people in your life. The pandemic has only added to the sting. In my family, Thanksgiving is the ultimate unskippable event, but over the past two years, we’ve skipped it twice because of Covid. Considering that there may only be 10 or 15 more Thanksgivings for us to be all together, two is a pretty big piece of that pie. In the months ahead, as you prepare to make plans — or to cancel them — I encourage you to do some Depressing Math of your own. Because whatever your situation, delusion about the time we have left serves no one. Now for the good news: We think a lot about those black lines: the roads not taken, the opportunities missed, the ones that got away. But most of us greatly underestimate the size of the lush green tree of possibilities that lie ahead of us. We underestimate future possibilities for the same reason we overestimate the time we have left with those we love: our intuition is not very imaginative. It’s a human instinct to believe the life we’re used to is how things will always be, both the good parts and the bad. Wallowing in regret carries an implicit assumption that we had agency in the past — that we could have had those other life paths if only we had made better decisions. When we think about the future, though, that feeling of agency often disappears, which can leave us feeling resigned and even hopeless. But the life we’ll be living 10 years from now will largely be determined not by our past selves but by our present and future selves. If we imagine what we might regret down the road, it’s very much in our hands to do something about it now. This is the good news about being a human. The time we have left with family and friends is not a law of nature like the weeks we have left to live. It’s a function of priorities and decisions. At our current pace of 10 to 15 days per year, my parents and I have at best a couple of hundred days left to hang out. But there’s nothing stopping us from changing that equation. Agreeing upon an additional annual family week each summer would almost double our remaining time together, while moving to the same city could multiply it by 10. Getting together with my friends one weekend a year would triple our pace and leave us with 15 percent of our total hangout time ahead, instead of just 5 percent. If the thought of only 12 more Museum of Natural History visits makes me sad, I can start going once a year and magically transform that number to 50. That big green tree is a reminder that we have the power to change so much of what seems set in stone. These two delusions — that we have countless time ahead of us and that we can’t change our course — are a recipe for complacency. Shedding them can wake us up and inspire us to live more wisely. The past couple of years has left us with a joy deficit. When we picture a post-Covid world, we imagine having our old lives back. But we can actually go a step further and make up for the missed experiences, flipping the deficit into a surplus. If Covid has given us anything, it’s a rare chance for a reset. Let’s take it.</td>\n",

– Back in 2008, Gears of War 2 introduced Horde mode, a co-operative way to play that saw five friends holing up and fending off wave after wave of hideous creatures. When it launches next year, Gears of War 3 will add a new Beast multiplayer mode that lets you and your friends get inside those marauding monsters. I played a few rounds of the promising five-player Beast co-op during a hands-on E3 event here Thursday. We spawned on a map called Mercy, a church where Marcus and his COG buddies attempt to make a final stand. Our mission was to spawn as a variety of deadly creatures and attempt to off the computer-controlled humans. The meatbags aren't exactly helpless – they're armed with the standard COG loadout, and they've also got mounted turrets, barbed wire and laser fences to keep the beasts from running roughshod over them. I started by spawning as the smallest monster – a Ticker. I steered the small, fast-moving suicide bug around the human barricades and self-destructed at the feet of two human gunners. That was two down and many more smoldering splatters of flesh and blood to go. Beast mode is still being tweaked, Gears of War 3's Rod Ferguson told me. When the game ships, players will have to earn the ability to spawn as bigger, meaner monsters by getting kills and causing damage. For the demo, we had free reign to spawn as almost anything we wanted. In this early stage, the creatures were split into four categories. Beasts are nasty little creatures like the Ticker and a new, slithering insectoid called a Serapede. (As this critter, I squirmed around the feet of humans, clamping their legs between my electrically charged tentacles. I racked up more kills as this monster than as any other.) Other categories will be familiar to anybody who has played Gears of War. Within the Humanoid and Drone categories, players can opt to spawn as a gun-wielding locust or play as a Kantus healer. Big beasts like the Boomers prove a real hoot to play. One of the behemoths totes a new gun called The Digger that launches burrowing missiles underground and beneath cover. A Mauler, with its giant flail, can smash human barbed-wire fences with a single swing. Destroying humans isn't as easy as it sounds, though. More than a few times, the A.I. defenders ran out the clock, surviving our attack and forcing us to replay the wave and slaughter more efficiently. Even in this early state, it's easy to tell that Beast mode will be as appealing to co-op gamers as Horde – which, I might add, is being refined and tweaked for Gears of War 3 as well. Gears of War 3 comes out April 2011 for the Xbox 360. Image courtesy Microsoft See Also:    \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                   In the age of the internet, it’s easier than ever to pull together lots of information to find the best doctor. And if you’re like most patients, the metric you probably rely on most is the doctor’s credentials. Where did she go to school? How many patients has he treated with this condition? You might also read some Yelp reviews about how nice this doctor is; how friendly and how caring. But all that probably seems secondary to the doctor’s skills; sure, it would be great to have a doctor whom you actually like, but that’s not going to influence your health the way the doctor’s competence will. But our research in the psychology department at Stanford University suggests that this view is mistaken. We found that having a doctor who is warm and reassuring actually improves your health. The simple things a doctor says and does to connect with patients can make a difference for health outcomes. Even a brief reassurance to a patient from a doctor might relieve the patient’s symptoms faster. In a recent study that one of us conducted, our research group recruited 76 participants to receive a skin prick test, a common procedure used in assessing allergies. The provider in this study pricked participants’ forearms with histamine, which makes skin itchy and red. Then, the doctor examined the allergic reactions. For some patients, the doctor examined them without saying much. But for other patients, the doctor had some words of encouragement. He told them: “From this point forward, your allergic reaction will start to diminish, and your rash and irritation will go away.” It turns out that this one sentence of assurance from a provider led patients to report that their reactions were less itchy — even though the doctor didn’t give any medication or treatment along with his words. Words alone from the provider relieved patients’ symptoms. This tells us that a physician’s words might be more powerful than we normally realize. And research shows that it is not only when patients are taking placebos that demeanor matters. In fact, provider words influence the efficacy of even our most powerful drugs and treatments. But as anyone who has been on the receiving end of a terse “You’re fine” knows, it’s not just what you say, it’s how you say it. In another study one of us worked on, we assessed whether the same words from a doctor influence patients differently depending on how warm or competent the doctor seemed. Again, patients received a histamine skin prick. Depending on what experimental group they were assigned to, patients met a provider trained to act in one of two very different ways. One group met the provider many of us dream of: she acted both warm and competent, calling patients by name, smiling, chatting and making eye contact. Her office was spotless, she spoke clearly and confidently, and she pulled off the medical procedures without a hitch. The other group, however, met the kind of doctor all too many of us have encountered: glued to the computer screen throughout the exam, the provider didn’t bother introducing herself and asked questions only to gather practical information. She also stumbled through some of the procedures in the messy exam room and sounded rather unsure of herself. In both groups, the provider gave patients a cream that she said was an antihistamine to reduce the allergic reaction and decrease itching. The cream was merely unscented hand lotion: a placebo. (A benefit of doing this research in the lab is that for the purposes of the study, we can temporarily lead patients to believe something that is untrue, something doctors could never do in a real clinic visit.) Decades of robust literature on placebo effects demonstrate that, even without any active ingredients, this cream should reduce the allergic reaction. But no one had examined how the doctor’s demeanor might influence the effects of a placebo treatment. Our study revealed that the placebo cream reduced participants’ allergic reactions only when the provider projected warmth and competence. When the provider acted colder and less competent, the placebo cream had no effect. It seems that it’s not just what the doctor says about a treatment that matters. It matters how the doctor who says it engages with patients. Doctors who are warmer and more competent are able to set more powerful expectations about medical treatments. Those positive expectations, in turn, have a measurable impact on health. So, we saw that when the provider projected both desirable qualities of warmth and competence, her words had an effect. When she projected neither, they did not. What about a provider who seems competent, but not warm? One other group of patients met a provider who seemed highly competent but remained businesslike and distant throughout the interaction, and they did not respond to the placebo cream as much as when the provider acted warm and competent. Patients of even the most accomplished and skillful doctors may benefit more when that doctor also connects with them. All of this research suggests that doctors who don’t connect with their patients may risk undermining a treatment’s success. Doctor-patient rapport is not just a fluffy, feel-good bonus that boosts Yelp reviews, but a component of medical care that has important effects on a patient’s physical health. Particularly as artificial intelligence promises a world where we don’t need to go to the doctor for minor questions, we should not overlook the value of interacting with a human doctor and hearing words of encouragement. And while physicians may worry that building rapport with patients requires too much time in a health care setting with visits that are already too short, there are simple ways to build warmth and competence — such as smiling, looking patients in the eye and asking their names — that don’t tax doctors beyond their limits. We often think the only parts of medical care that really matter are the “active” ingredients of medicine: the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. But focusing only on these ingredients leaves important components of care underappreciated and underutilized. To really help people flourish, health care works better when it includes caring.

       "11608  WASHINGTON — The Biden administration and its allies are assembling a punishing set of financial, technology and military sanctions against Russia that they say would go into effect within hours of an invasion of Ukraine, hoping to make clear to President Vladimir V. Putin the high cost he would pay if he sends troops across the border. In interviews, officials described details of those plans for the first time, just ahead of a series of diplomatic negotiations to defuse the crisis with Moscow, one of the most perilous moments in Europe since the end of the Cold War. The talks begin on Monday in Geneva and then move across Europe. The plans the United States has discussed with allies in recent days include cutting off Russia’s largest financial institutions from global transactions, imposing an embargo on American-made or American-designed technology needed for defense-related and consumer industries, and arming insurgents in Ukraine who would conduct what would amount to a guerrilla war against a Russian military occupation, if it comes to that. Such moves are rarely telegraphed in advance. But with the negotiations looming — and the fate of Europe’s post-Cold War borders and NATO’s military presence on the continent at stake — President Biden’s advisers say they are trying to signal to Mr. Putin exactly what he would face, at home and abroad, in hopes of influencing his decisions in coming weeks. The talks on Monday will be led by the deputy secretary of state, Wendy R. Sherman, an experienced diplomat who negotiated the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran. Russian officials are expected to press their demands for “security guarantees,” including prohibiting the deployment of any missiles in Europe that could strike Russia and the placement of weaponry or troops in former Soviet states that joined NATO after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Mr. Putin is also demanding an end to NATO expansion, including a promise that Ukraine could never join the nuclear alliance. While the Biden administration has said it is willing to discuss all Russian security concerns — and has a long list of its own — the demands amount to a dismantling of the security architecture of Europe built after the Soviet Union’s collapse. On Wednesday, members of the NATO alliance will meet with Russia in Brussels. The next day in Vienna, Ukrainian officials will also be at the table, for the first time, for talks at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. But with 57 members, that group is so large that few expect serious negotiations. American diplomats worry that after the whirlwind week, the Russians could declare that their security concerns are not being met — and use the failure of talks as a justification for military action. “No one should be surprised if Russia instigates a provocation or incident,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Friday, and “then tries to use it to justify military intervention, hoping that by the time the world realizes the ruse, it’ll be too late.” This time, he said, “we’ve been clear with Russia about what it will face if it continues on this path, including economic measures that we haven’t used before — massive consequences.” That warning, however, is an unspoken acknowledgment that the Obama administration’s response in 2014, when Mr. Putin last invaded parts of Ukraine, was too tentative and mild. At that time, Mr. Putin surprised the world by annexing Crimea and fueling a grinding proxy war in eastern Ukraine. Now, American officials say they are trying to learn from their past mistakes. An internal review of those actions, conducted by the White House in recent weeks, concluded that while Obama-era sanctions damaged Russia’s economy and led to a sell-off of its currency, they failed at their central strategic objective: to cause so much pain that Mr. Putin would be forced to withdraw. Nearly eight years later, Russia still holds Crimea and has ignored most of the diplomatic commitments it made in the negotiations that followed, known as the Minsk accords. Those sanctions started with actions against some smaller Russian banks and individuals directly involved in the invasion. Virtually all of the sanctions — and additional measures imposed after Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and after the SolarWinds cyberattack in 2020 that sabotaged computer programs used by the federal government and American companies — remain in place. But there is scant evidence that they have deterred Mr. Putin, who began building up forces near the Ukrainian border just as Mr. Biden announced his response to SolarWinds last spring. When asked recently whether he could point to any evidence that the Russians were deterred by recent sanctions, a senior aide to Mr. Biden paused a moment and then said, “No, none.” Rather than start with moves against small banks and on-the-ground military commanders, officials said, the new sanctions would be directed at cutting off the largest Russian financial institutions that depend on global financial transfers. The plan was described by one official as a “high-impact, quick-action response that we did not pursue in 2014.” The officials declined to say whether the United States was prepared to cut Russia off from the SWIFT system, which executes global financial transactions between more than 1,100 banks in 200 countries. But European officials say they have discussed that possibility — something most major European powers had declined to consider until recently, for fear that Russia might retaliate by attempting to cut off gas and oil flows in the winter, even briefly. The SWIFT cutoff has been used against Iran with some success. But Cynthia Roberts, a professor of political science at Hunter College, noted that Russia had learned a lot about “global sanctions-proofing,” and she expressed doubt that the country would suffer as much as American officials contend if it were disconnected from SWIFT. “They would definitely take a big hit,” she said at a seminar held this past week by the Center for the National Interest. But she noted that Russia had stockpiled hundreds of billions in gold and dollar reserves and that the Bank of China had joined Russia’s own domestic version of SWIFT. That raises the possibility that Russia and China, as part of their expanding partnership, might join forces to help Moscow evade the West’s action. The bottom line, she said, is that “sanctions have a very poor coercive track record.” The technology sanctions would target some of Mr. Putin’s favored industries — particularly aerospace and arms, which are major producers of revenue for the Russian government. The focus would be on Russian-built fighter aircraft, antiaircraft systems, antisatellite systems, space systems and emerging technologies where Russia is hoping to make gains, like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Similar export controls have been surprisingly effective against China’s leading producer of cellphones, Huawei, which for a while was among the top providers of smartphones to the world. That part of its business has all but collapsed in the past year because it cannot obtain advanced chips. But the Russian economy bears little resemblance to China’s, and it is not clear that it is equally vulnerable to an embargo of semiconductors and other microelectronics that are critical to Chinese manufacturing. There are other options under consideration that go well beyond merely banning the sale of computer chips. In one additional step, according to American officials, the Commerce Department could issue a ruling that would essentially ban the export of any consumer goods to Russia — from cellphones and laptop computers to refrigerators and washing machines — that contain American-made or American-designed electronics. That would apply not only to American makers, but also to European, South Korean and other foreign manufacturers that use American chips or software. Unlike China, Russia does not make many of these products — and the effects on consumers could be broad. But a senior European official said there was still a debate about whether the Russian people would blame Mr. Putin, or the United States and its allies, for their inability to buy the goods. While the Commerce and Treasury Departments work on sanctions that would maximize America’s advantages over Russia, the Pentagon is developing plans that have echoes of the proxy wars of the 1960s and ’70s. To underscore the potential pain for Russia, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark A. Milley, spoke with his Russian counterpart two weeks ago and delivered a stark message: Yes, he said, you could invade Ukraine and probably roll over the Ukrainian military, which stands little chance of repelling a far larger, better armed Russian force. But the swift victory would be followed, General Milley told Gen. Valery Gerasimov, by a bloody insurgency, similar to the one that led to the Soviet retreat from Afghanistan more than three decades ago, according to officials familiar with the discussion. General Milley did not detail to General Gerasimov the planning underway in Washington to support an insurgency, a so-called “porcupine strategy” to make invading Ukraine hard for the Russians to swallow. That includes the advance positioning of arms for Ukrainian insurgents, probably including Stinger antiaircraft missiles, that could be used against Russian forces. More than a month ago, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, created a new interagency planning cell to examine a range of contingencies if Mr. Putin goes ahead with an invasion. The cell, which reports directly to Mr. Sullivan, includes representatives from the National Security Council, the intelligence agencies and the Departments of Defense, State, Treasury, Energy and Homeland Security. The cell is attempting to tailor responses to the many types of attacks that could unfold in the next few weeks, from cyberattacks aimed at crippling Ukraine’s electric grid and pipelines to the seizure of small or large amounts of territory. Intelligence officials said recently that they thought the least likely possibility was a full-scale invasion in which the Russians try to take the capital, Kyiv. Many of the assessments, however, have explored more incremental moves by Mr. Putin, which could include seizing a bit more land in the Donbas region, where war has ground into a stalemate, or a land bridge to Crimea. Several officials familiar with the planning say the administration is looking at European nations that could provide more aid to support Ukrainian forces before any conflict, as well as in the initial stages of a Russian invasion. Lt. Col. Anton Semelroth, a Defense Department spokesman, noted in December that the United States had already committed over $2.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since 2014, including $450 million in 2021 alone. Over the past three months, it has delivered 180 Javelin missiles, two patrol boats, ammunition for grenade launchers, machine guns, secure radios, medical equipment and other items that U.S. officials describe as defensive in nature. But the planning cell is considering more lethal weaponry, such as antiaircraft weapons. After visiting Ukraine last month, Representative Seth Moulton, Democrat of Massachusetts and a former Marine officer, said that in his view, “We need to make any incursion by Russia more painful — Day 1 painful, not six months from now painful.” “We have a short window to take decisive action to deter Putin from a serious invasion,” Mr. Moulton said in an interview. “I worry our current deterrent tactics are responding to an invasion rather than preventing it.” One option likely to be discussed at NATO this coming week is a plan to increase, possibly by several thousand, the number of troops stationed in the Baltics and in Southeast Europe. On Friday, Mr. Blinken again warned that if the Russians invade, NATO would deploy more forces along the borders between NATO nations and Russian-controlled territory.    \n",

For one thing, it dealt with sensitive subject matter. And it didn’t come from a person — it came from YouTube, the largest video site on the internet. During an interview at South by Southwest in Austin, Tex., YouTube’s chief executive, Susan Wojcicki, announced that the company she leads would enlist Wikipedia’s help to deal with the proliferation of conspiracy theories and misinformation on its platform. The plan was presented as just one of many ways that YouTube, which is owned by Google, would address mounting concerns about its content. But it highlighted a jarring dynamic: Here was Google, a company with revenue in excess of $100 billion last year, calling on a volunteer-built, donation-funded nonprofit organization to help it solve a crisis. Specifically, Ms. Wojcicki said, YouTube would soon begin experimenting with what it called “information cues” sourced from the online encyclopedia. The cues would appear as captions and article links beneath videos that dealt with topics related to popular conspiracy theories — she used the moon landing and “chemtrails” as examples. Her interviewer, Nicholas Thompson of Wired Magazine, gently teased, “So, YouTube will be sending people to text?” Away from the conference stage, the responses were anything but gentle. “I’m genuinely curious whether YouTube management is a bunch of Pollyannas who have never watched the videos on their platforms, or a bunch of people who just don’t care,” Renee DiResta, a researcher and expert in online disinformation, tweeted. Justin Brookman, the director for consumer privacy and technology policy at Consumers Union, called the plan “a disingenuous cop-out that will make Wikipedia’s job harder.” Others noted what seemed like an obvious point: Can’t anyone edit Wikipedia, including the conspiracy theorists themselves? From the Wikimedia Foundation, which oversees Wikipedia, the first response was confusion. YouTube is doing what? Katherine Maher, the executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation, sounded as if she wouldn’t have minded a heads up. “When the announcement came out, we were surprised that we hadn’t been contacted,” Ms. Maher said in an interview. She had learned about YouTube’s plans at the same time as everyone else — including Wikipedia’s army of volunteer contributors, some of whom were not pleased with the idea that an internet colossus had casually declared that it would outsource one of its knottiest problems to a relatively small nonprofit organization. “Wikipedia is not something that just exists,” Ms. Maher said. “It takes work and it requires labor.” A Wikipedia editor who goes by the handle SEMMENDINGER shared a concern on a contributor discussion page, writing, “My worry is that the people viewing these sorts of videos in the first place are the same people who wholeheartedly are in agreement with the content.” Another editor, Doc James, was more sanguine. “I do not imagine many problems,” he said. “We have lots of policies to help support those who come with good references and rebuff those without.” YouTube’s announcement might be chalked up to an unintentional miscommunication or a public relations misstep. But for Wikipedia, it was part of a familiar pattern. A cross between a piece of infrastructure, a public commons and an online community, Wikipedia has been a boon to some of the largest companies in the world since it started nearly two decades ago. Whatever benefit Google hopes to get from using the online encyclopedia to fact-check YouTube videos is likely to pale in comparison with the value it receives from including Wikipedia entries in its search results. Google’s “Knowledge Graph,” which displays certain answers to search queries in separate, authoritative-looking boxes on the right side of a computer screen, draws heavily from Wikipedia. Furthermore, virtually every voice assistant, including Amazon’s Echo and Apple’s Siri, uses the site to give customers a wide range of answers to their questions. Wikipedia has also proved invaluable to tech companies as they develop artificial intelligence and translation services — as a multilanguage corpus for researchers, it is unparalleled (and, of course, free). “The degree to which the Wikipedia data has informed computer science is pretty astonishing,” said Brent Hecht, an assistant professor at Northwestern University who has studied Wikipedia’s relationships with tech companies and online communities. “Wikipedia definitely creates massively more value for these companies than they put in.” With the YouTube announcement, Wikipedia finds itself in a predicament similar to that of a small town after it has been chosen as the site of a new Walmart: Some municipalities have said that the retail giant creates undue stress on local police forces, straining them to the breaking point with endless calls to deal with petty crimes at the super stores. Wikipedia’s lopsided relationships can also amplify pre-existing internal problems. Its contributors skew white and male, for example, leading to predictable outcomes — just 17 percent of the subjects of biographies on the site are women. Wikipedia is taking steps to address the issue, but the next generation of consumer tech is being built on top of it — and its gaps and biases — in the meantime. Having come of age in the era of desktop and laptop computers, Wikipedia is also struggling to bring itself into the smartphone era (not to mention whatever comes next). “If we have interfaces like Alexa, for example, they’re using infrastructure and content generated by editors, but they’re not really encouraging readers to contribute in any way,” said Dariusz Jemielniak, who published a book-length ethnographic study of Wikipedia and now sits on the Wikimedia Foundation’s board. “They might not even realize it’s coming from Wikipedia,” he added. “It would be nice if people who take also give a little bit.” The main problem with YouTube’s presumptuous announcement, Mr. Jemielniak suggested, is that Wikipedia is not necessarily geared toward breaking news — and conspiracy theories tend to move at lightning speed during times of crisis. Recently, for instance, YouTube was rife with conspiracy videos about the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., and it is unclear what even a thorough and well-sourced Wikipedia article could have done to dissuade an audience intent on believing that students at the school were paid “crisis actors” carrying out orders. More to the point, Mr. Jemielniak said, if Google wanted help from Wikipedia, it could have asked. Ms. Maher agreed. At the very least, she said, it would be nice to have “a primary point of contact” at Google and companies like it — “someone who is invested in thinking of us an entity rather than just a resource.” As it stands, no such person has that role — though YouTube has reached out to the foundation since the announcement, and the two organizations are regularly in touch in less formal ways. (Google declined to comment for this article. Ms. Maher said of their interaction this week, “It was good for a start.”) Then there’s the issue of money. As important as Wikipedia may be to some of the richest companies in the world, it is, in financial terms, comparatively minuscule, with a yearly budget of less than $100 million — a rounding error for big tech. (It should be noted that Google has made one-off contributions to Wikipedia in the past and includes the Wikimedia Foundation in a program through which it matches employee donations, which netted the foundation around $1 million last year.) For now, Wikipedians — among the most central and least visible participants in this conversation — seem not overly perturbed. “Looks like we have more work to do,” wrote one, after the YouTube announcement. “I doubt that much will change anytime soon.”    \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I have good news and bad news for you. Let’s start with the bad: a concept I call Depressing Math. Check this out: That’s one box for every week of a 90-year life. It often feels like we have countless weeks ahead of us. But actually, it’s just a few thousand — a small-enough number to fit neatly in a single image. Once you visualize the human life span, it becomes clear that so many parts of life we think of as “countless” are in fact quite countable. I love going to the American Museum of Natural History, and I’ve been three times since I moved to New York in 2009. If that rate continues, I’ll step into the museum 12 more times. For an activity I think of as “something I like to do,” that number seems shockingly low. I also love going to the movies, but ever since it became effortless to stream everything at home, I’ve been averaging one or two movie theater trips a year. In my head, I’ll go out for hundreds more movies in my life, but the real amount is probably some weirdly small number like 53. Depressing Math is especially depressing when you’re living through a pandemic. Covid hasn’t taken away our weeks, but it has robbed us of our favorite activities — experiences that are already in short supply. But perhaps the hardest math to process — and, in turn, the hardest Covid pill to swallow — has to do with our relationships. I grew up spending some time with my parents almost every day. Since turning 19 and moving away for good, I’ve averaged about 10 to 15 days a year with them. If I’m one of the lucky ones, I’ll have quality time with my parents until I’m 60. That means that the day I headed off to college, I had something like 350 remaining parent days total — the amount of time I had with them every year of my childhood. What it boils down to is this: My life, in the best-case scenario, will consist of around 20 years of in-person parent time. The first 19 happened over the course of my first 19 years. The final year is spread out over the rest of my life. When I left for college, I had many decades left with living parents, but only about one year of time left to spend with them. It’s the same story with childhood friends. I spent high school sitting around with the same four friends, notching somewhere around 1,000 hangouts by the time we scattered off to different cities. Since then, our text thread keeps us in touch, but we’ve only managed to get the whole group together for a weekend every few years — about 10 total days each decade. It feels like we’re smack in the middle of our lives together, but like me and my parents, the high school group is currently enjoying its final 5 percent of in-person time together. Depressing Math reveals a cold truth: While you may not be anywhere near the end of your life, you may very well be nearing the end of your time spent with some of the most important people in your life. The pandemic has only added to the sting. In my family, Thanksgiving is the ultimate unskippable event, but over the past two years, we’ve skipped it twice because of Covid. Considering that there may only be 10 or 15 more Thanksgivings for us to be all together, two is a pretty big piece of that pie. In the months ahead, as you prepare to make plans — or to cancel them — I encourage you to do some Depressing Math of your own. Because whatever your situation, delusion about the time we have left serves no one. Now for the good news: We think a lot about those black lines: the roads not taken, the opportunities missed, the ones that got away. But most of us greatly underestimate the size of the lush green tree of possibilities that lie ahead of us. We underestimate future possibilities for the same reason we overestimate the time we have left with those we love: our intuition is not very imaginative. It’s a human instinct to believe the life we’re used to is how things will always be, both the good parts and the bad. Wallowing in regret carries an implicit assumption that we had agency in the past — that we could have had those other life paths if only we had made better decisions. When we think about the future, though, that feeling of agency often disappears, which can leave us feeling resigned and even hopeless. But the life we’ll be living 10 years from now will largely be determined not by our past selves but by our present and future selves. If we imagine what we might regret down the road, it’s very much in our hands to do something about it now. This is the good news about being a human. The time we have left with family and friends is not a law of nature like the weeks we have left to live. It’s a function of priorities and decisions. At our current pace of 10 to 15 days per year, my parents and I have at best a couple of hundred days left to hang out. But there’s nothing stopping us from changing that equation. Agreeing upon an additional annual family week each summer would almost double our remaining time together, while moving to the same city could multiply it by 10. Getting together with my friends one weekend a year would triple our pace and leave us with 15 percent of our total hangout time ahead, instead of just 5 percent. If the thought of only 12 more Museum of Natural History visits makes me sad, I can start going once a year and magically transform that number to 50. That big green tree is a reminder that we have the power to change so much of what seems set in stone. These two delusions — that we have countless time ahead of us and that we can’t change our course — are a recipe for complacency. Shedding them can wake us up and inspire us to live more wisely. The past couple of years has left us with a joy deficit. When we picture a post-Covid world, we imagine having our old lives back. But we can actually go a step further and make up for the missed experiences, flipping the deficit into a surplus. If Covid has given us anything, it’s a rare chance for a reset. Let’s take it.    \n",

But this new footage of these futuristic bots hearkens back to something more retro — the pixelated shooters of arcades yore. GRASP's engineers taught a group of miniature nano-quadrotors to fly in rectangular formations. I can picture a phalanx of these buggers someday roaming the skies, each armed individually with a taser or scimitar or some other implement of unpleasantry. Their only weakness? A bazooka that shoots quarters.

Day! That's right, it's March 14, or 3.14. To celebrate Pi Day (and get the coronavirus out of our heads for just a moment), we've rounded up all the best deals from participating tech companies. We've got laptops, iPads, Fire tablet deals, and other tech we like here at WIRED. There's plenty of other great discounts here too, Pi-related or not. So order yourself a pie or pizza and celebrate the year's nerdiest made up holiday with us. If you buy something using the links in our stories, we may earn a small affiliate commission. Here’s how this works. You can also support our reporting and reviewing by purchasing a 1-year print + digital WIRED subscription for $5 (Discounted). The best Pi Day deals we've seen are happening in the Microsoft store, which has some great deals on laptops from all manufacturers. Be sure to read through our guide to the best laptops, the best cheap laptops, and the best gaming PCs for more buying advice. This is one of the best times of the year to pick up some new outdoor gear at a steep discount. Stores are clearing out winter inventory, so you can stock up and save big on skiing and snowboarding gear for next year, as well as grab some camping and hiking gear for summer. Backcountry has a good sale going, as does REI. Here are some of our favorite deals from both.

       "      <td>As video games give players more freedom to explore complex digital worlds, it becomes more challenging for a CG character to naturally move and interact with everything in it. So to prevent those awkward transitions between pre-programmed movements, researchers have turned to AI and deep learning to make video game characters move almost as realistically as real humans do. To help make video game characters walk, run, jump, and perform other movements as realistically as possible, video game developers will often rely on human performances that are captured and translated to digital characters. It produces results that are faster and better looking than animating video game characters by hand, but it’s impossible to plan for every possible way a character will interact with a digital world, according to the researchers. Game developers try to plan for as many possibilities as they can, but they ultimately have to rely on software to transition between animations of a character walking up to a chair, and then sitting down on it, and more often than not, those segues feel stilted, unnatural, and can diminish a player’s experience. Computer scientists from the University of Edinburgh and Adobe Research have come up with a novel solution they’ll be presenting at the ACM Siggraph Asia conference being held in Brisbane, Australia, next month. And like many breakthroughs that have come before it, it involves leveraging the capabilities of deep learning neural networks to smooth over the animation hiccups that video games currently exhibit. To create the convincing but unsettling deepfake videos you’ll find all over the internet now, a neural network is first trained by studying a given person’s face (often a celebrity) from every possible angle and with every imaginable expression using a database of tens of thousands of headshots of the subject. It’s a time consuming process, but with that knowledge, face swaps can be automatically created that look impossibly lifelike. Run it outA watch that is highly durable in the event you fall over, lets you know if you’re over or under training based on your performance, can help you create custom workouts, and gives you all the stats you could ever want. A similar approach is being taken for this research, but instead of training a neural network on a database of faces, it studies a collection of motions captured and digitized from a live performer on a soundstage. For the best results, it does require a fairly large database of motions for the system to analyze, with a performer going through the motions of picking up objects, climbing over things, or plopping down in a chair. But it doesn’t have to be infinitely inclusive, the neural network can take what it’s learned and adapt it to almost any situation or environment, while still producing natural looking results and movements, according to the researchers. It’s filling in the gaps between a character walking up to a chair, slowing down, turning their body, and then sitting, but intelligently linking all of those movements and animations together to hide the seams. There are other advantages to teaching video games how characters should move and interact with things instead of pre-animating those motions, such as helping to reduce the file sizes of games and the amount of data that has to be processed and shared: something that will become even more relevant as streaming games becomes more and more prevalent. This approach also paves the way for more complex interactions for video game characters. How often do you see more than two characters end up fighting each other? Never, except in pre-animated cut scenes. The next version of Red Dead Redemption could finally include real barroom brawls.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Jay-Z’s company Roc Nation have filed takedown notices against “deepfake” videos that use artificial intelligence to make him rap Billy Joel’s We Didn’t Start the Fire and Hamlet’s “To be or not to be” soliloquy. The anonymous creator of the YouTube-hosted videos, known as Vocal Synthesis, has said that copyright notices were filed by Roc Nation, stating: “This content unlawfully uses an AI to impersonate our client’s voice.” The two aforementioned videos have been removed, though others remain, including one of the rapper taking on the Book of Genesis. Vocal Synthesis said – via a deepfake video using the ersatz voices of Barack Obama and Donald Trump – that they had “no malicious purpose” and were “disappointed that Jay-Z and Roc Nation have decided to bully a small YouTuber in this way”. The Guardian has contacted Roc Nation for comment. Deepfake videos have already caused great controversy in political and celebrity circles, with California outlawing them in 2018, and Facebook banning them in January. The technology has most notoriously been used to create fake pornographic videos featuring famous actors – the PornHub website banned deepfakes in 2018. Deepfakes differ from so-called “cheapfakes”, which don’t involve AI and instead feature re-edited footage with the aim of distorting the truth. Famous examples include a video of Nancy Pelosi doctored to make her look drunk, and one of Keir Starmer created by the Tory party for social media where he appeared unable to answer a question. Posting on Twitter this week, Donald Trump shared a fake gif of Joe Biden sticking his tongue out. There are debates over the copyright implications of AI-created videos such as the Jay-Z performances, with digital access advocates Creative Commons arguing: “It is ill-advised to force the application of the copyright system – an antiquated system that has yet to adapt to the digital environment – on to AI.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>IBM is cutting the pay of some employees in its services business by 10 percent for six months while they spend up to one day a week in training programs. The move is unusual, according to work-force experts, but could become a trend in retraining programs as both corporations and workers struggle to stay competitive in a fast-changing economy. Some disgruntled IBM employees                                         say the step is a cost-cutting tactic disguised as a training program. IBM says the program is limited to a small number of employees and is meant to avoid laying them off. Last Friday, some workers in the company’s outsourcing business received emails informing them of the program. It stated that “a recent assessment” had identified workers who “have not kept                                         pace with acquiring the skills and expertise needed to address changing client needs, technology and market requirements.” The email then added, “You have been identified as one of these employees,”                                         according to a copy sent to The New York Times by an IBM worker. The training is intended to take about a day a week, up to a total of 23 days. During that time, the email stated, “you will receive 90 percent of your current base salary.” Employees receiving the offer are given little choice, other than to look elsewhere in the company “for opportunities for which your skills may be a better match.” The IBM program was reported on Monday by Computerworld. A spokeswoman for IBM, Trink Guarino, emphasized that the salary cut-and-retraining program was by no means standard practice across the company. A few hundred people in the technology services outsourcing business                                         in the United States, she said, were affected. “This involves a very small number of people,” Ms. Guarino said, “and we’re working to preserve their jobs.” The technology marketplace is shifting quickly, Ms. Guarino noted, as corporate customers move to adopt cloud and mobile computing, and advanced data analysis. The training programs will focus on those areas, she said. The workers are in the IBM business unit that manages technology operations for other companies, in long-term outsourcing contracts that typically extend for five or more years. The IBM workers log billable hours, and                                         if they spend a day a week on training, that amounts to 20 percent fewer billable hours. IBM regards the 10 percent salary cuts as a form of “co-investment” with the cost shared by workers and the                                         company. Some IBM workers don’t see it that way. One person who has worked for IBM for more than 20 years said that the skills assessment referred to in the email was not tailored to individuals. All the workers in his                                         group, he said, were being assigned the same training program. He noted that the Indian workers who were part of the same team doing similar work for the same client were not involved. “It seems like a cost-cutting exercise that is being presented as a training program,” said the IBM worker, who asked not to be identified because he feared consequences for criticizing the company. A crucial issue, according to Peter Cappelli, a professor at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, is the nature of the training in the IBM program. “If the skills they are learning                                         are useful outside of IBM, it may be a pretty good deal for the workers,” he said. “If not, it just looks like cost cutting.” Mr. Cappelli, director of Wharton’s Center for Human Resources, said that the concept of co-investing, with the costs shared by workers and companies, is “where we are going to end up going in retraining.”                                         Already, employees and companies routinely split the tuition costs for workers who choose to take college courses to improve their skills. However, he added, the tuition programs are different from the IBM initiative in that they are voluntary, with both worker and company choosing to make contributions. “This one seems rougher,” Mr. Cappelli said, “because the company is forcing you to take a pay cut.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Disheveled, eyes bruised with fatigue, and feeling grungy after two days of showerless toil, 190 video game designers, artists and programmers disembarked on Saturday afternoon from the rain-slicked California Zephyr at the Emeryville, Calif., Amtrak station. The travelers — some of whom had come from as far away as Zambia and Pakistan — had taken part in Train Jam, which uses the trip from Chicago to this city just north of Oakland as both an opportunity and a time frame for strangers to come together and, amid laptops, headphones and virtual-reality headsets, create video games. “You will never know true happiness until you’ve showered after a 52-hour-long train ride,” Adriel Wallick, the event’s organizer, wrote on Twitter after arriving in the Bay Area. Ms. Wallick, 29, an independent game developer from the Netherlands, conceived Train Jam as a way of making a creative venture out of the journey to the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, the world’s largest annual gathering of game makers. Ms. Wallick said the idea came to her during a trip from Boston to Seattle three years ago: “I realized that a cross-country train ride would work perfectly as a game jam,” she said, referring to the increasingly prevalent events in which participants develop video games over an allotted time period. And the views aren’t bad, either. Along the 2,438-mile route, the train weaves through the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada, shifting scenery from cities to mountains to deserts. “It’s hard to not be inspired by all of the changes and beauty around you,” Ms. Wallick added. Each of the 50 or so video games made during Train Jam will be playable throughout the week at the cavernous Moscone Center, where the conference is being held. More than 26,000 people are expected to attend the 30th Game Developers Conference, which began on Monday and ends on Friday. That these little games are being given a platform on such a sizable stage is indicative of the industry’s kaleidoscopic expansion. Today a video game like Minecraft, originally built by a lone programmer in his bedroom, competes with the titans of the industry, such as Call of Duty and FIFA, which are made by a battalion of workers and supported by the screaming winds of multimillion-dollar marketing. That kind of blockbuster game making is a high-risk venture, with spiraling budgets and development cycles that can last three years. Unproven ideas are perilous, leading most studios to cling to bankable sequels. Game jams, by contrast, are a low-risk way to experiment with new concepts without the need for a commercial aesthetic, an apolitical stance or a bug-free release. Two recent games — Surgeon Simulator, about a hapless surgeon, and Goat Simulator, about an anarchic goat — are among the well-known irreverent games to spring from game jams. Even the games that don’t blossom into commercial releases can be useful. “It is a place to fail, happily,” said Susan Gold, founder of Global Game Jam, which invites people to join in, wherever they’re based, during a 48-hour period. Two days is enough time to explore an idea without burning out, and at these jams, programmers, writers, musicians, artists and project managers can all find a use for their talents. The format also encourages networking and stepping outside a rigid development repertoire. For those who usually work with sprawling teams, a game jam can break the monotony and bring fresh focus. For independent game makers who work alone, it can be an opportunity to test an idea, socialize and share skills. Train Jam accentuates the sense of expedition that comes with all creative work. Like any collaboration, game making is full of diversions and rewrites. A train journey, by contrast, is mostly predictable; the landscape may change, but everybody starts and ends at the same point. Placing game making within the context of a journey provides useful constraints. The term “game jam” was coined by the wunderkind programmer Chris Hecker, known for his work on the pioneering artificial-intelligence-based game Spore. In 2002, he invited 13 friends to join him in Oakland, Calif., to make games over a four-day period. They called it Indie Game Jam, a reference to musical jam sessions. Since Mr. Hecker’s event, the format has been adopted around the world, with jams unfolding in unusual places, often to a theme. February’s Splash Jam, for example, was held during a 745-mile cruise along the coast of Norway. Its 100 participants were tasked with making games related to “Beginnings.” Isolation Jam, which takes place in June, is set on a remote, Internet-less farm in northern Iceland. Castle Jam changes its location each year. For Asylum Jam, participants make horror games without the genre clichés related to mental health. Ms. Gold’s inaugural Global Game Jam was in 2009. She started the event with the aim of coordinating a game jam on every continent. “I was thinking that maybe we would get 10 or 20 locations to sign up,” she said. But more than 1,500 people took part in 23 countries. By this January, the number had risen to close to 40,000 participants in 93 countries. They created more than 6,800 games, many of which are available free to download and sample. The rise of game jams also shows a mounting appetite for alternatives to sports and shooter games. Lyst Jam is a Scandinavian game jam, held in June, in which attendees make video games about romance, love and sex. (Lyst is the Swedish word for lust.) “We feel the medium misrepresents the world we live in, and needs to be less narrow in gender, stories, themes and game mechanics,” said Andrea Hasselager, the jam’s organizer. “There’s an intense feeling of belonging to a group,” she said. “Combine that with a space where you shut out the concerns of everyday life, and the adrenaline rush of working all night and day to see something come to life, and it becomes irresistible.” For Adam Saltsman, an independent game maker from Austin, Tex., whose hit game Canabalt was conceived during a game jam, the appeal is more straightforward. “I think nerds like to party and make stuff,” he said. “It’s also a nice way to kind of get a bunch of resources into one geographical location, and it’s a great excuse to try something new.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Monster Train has one hell of a premise. You're the conductor of a locomotive descending through the seven layers of hell—the denizens of the underworld hot on your tail. Harpies, warlocks, and abyssal knights are constantly breaching the walls, and players have to muster their own infernal forces to consign the interlopers back to the pits. In the hands of a gigantic studio like Blizzard or Ubisoft or EA, it'd be easy to imagine Monster Train as a sprawling, open-world adventure. We'd explore every nook and cranny of perdition—following waypoints, climbing watch towers, maxing out talent trees. But Shiny Shoe, the developer behind the game, chose a different direction entirely. Instead of a globe-trotting action game or a titanic RPG, Monster Train is a relatively simple digital card game, where the struggle against the Seraphim plays out with a deck and a dream. In 2021, that was more than enough to blow up the charts. \"Card games are something that's a lot more accessible to us and other indie studios as a format. In fact, a lot of triple-A studios are kinda staying away from them. We want to do the things that they aren't,\" says Andrew Krausnick, creative director of Monster Train, in an interview with WIRED. \"We're not going to compete with Call of Duty or whatever.\" Monster Train has been a runaway success. The game consistently racks up thousands of concurrent players on Steam, and its Metacritic average sits at a solid 86. The core gameplay will be familiar to veterans of board games like Dominion or Thunderstone: The player starts with a small, weak deck and slowly adds better pieces to it over the course of a campaign, eventually molding it into an efficient, demon-killing machine.  That is a paradigm shift. For decades, there's been a quiet schism between the video game and tabletop communities. The two industries rarely mingled, and when they did, it was usually in the form of a licensed adaptation—the mobile version of Pandemic, for example. But lately, in an ecosystem of airtight MOBAs, 60-frames-per-second shooters, and endless RPGs, many gamers prefer to drag and drop cards on a computer. Monster Train isn't alone. We are living through a renaissance of video games that take direct influence from tabletop ideas. Take 2017’s Slay the Spire, one of the most popular games on the internet. A lonely knight ventures through a grim gauntlet of beasties, slowly adding better cards to their deck. There's Dicey Dungeons, a roguelike that applies Yahtzee-style rolling to maximize absurd combos, like you're shaking up a grip of dice on the kitchen counter. In Loop Hero, an early 2021 darling, players slam down sets of mountain tiles and forest grottos as if they're constructing the city of Carcassonne, because in this adventure, there is nothing more powerful than a four-of-a-kind. All of these games come from indie studios, and each of them proudly don their influences. In today's gaming culture, the next big hit can fit into a regulation deck. That is the belief of Chalit Noonchoo, game lead of Gordian Quest, an RPG released onto Steam Early Access last year that melds elements of Dungeons &amp; Dragons character construction with thoughtful deck-building strategy. Like Krausnick, Noonchoo says that card games are much more achievable for the average small studio compared to other, more technical genres. \"It makes us less beholden to expectations like having triple-A visuals, tons of animations, or heavy cut scenes that are difficult to pull off for us,\" he says. \"We try and focus our limited resources into making the game look and feel good at the most basic level.\" He holds up his end of the bargain. The core appeal of games like Gordian Quest is the sublime precision of the gameplay—there is a certain clarity that comes from staring at a hand of cards that can't be replicated elsewhere. But Noonchoo makes it clear that there is nothing straightforward about merging the digital and analog realms. If anything, Gordian Quest has required him to completely rethink how game design works. \"There's a lot more granular control and flow in a traditional game. Status effects can last for fractions of a second, area of effects can be increased by marginal percentages, and damage ranges can be scaled up to the thousands or millions,\" he says. \"In a card game, it is important to keep numbers small and each bonus impactful, as the player only has so much bandwidth to mentally track the components of every play, which presents an additional layer of challenge for us.\" Of course, one of the advantages of building a board game for PCs is the ability to pave over some of the annoying inefficiencies of tabletop. Nobody needs to reshuffle their discard pile in Monster Train, and all of the damage calculations happen automatically. Krausnick notes that one of his favorite mechanics in the game is the ability to duplicate cards in your deck. An idea like that would be untenable if Monster Train was played in a dining room, but on Steam, all it takes is a single line of code. Perhaps that's one of the reasons this digitized interpretation of the genre has penetrated into the mainstream. The finicky, mathematical upkeep of, say, an average game of Magic is nowhere to be found. Instead, the all-seeing power of the algorithm guides us every step of the way. \"We can let the mechanics get more complicated without becoming inaccessible,\" says Krausnick. \"In a physical game, you'd have to run the numbers and play it out, and it'd take four hours to play.\" All of this makes you consider where the industry will go from here. The tabletop industry is enjoying a historic boom, growing 20 percent in 2020 alone, which means that the avenues of influence into the Steam charts will likely stay open for quite some time. But Thomas Moon Kang, creator of the real-time card battler One Step From Eden, has a different theory. He notes that some of the most popular board games of the past few years (Gloomhaven, Pandemic: Legacy, Mansions of Madness) all attempt, in various different ways, to imitate video games. Some of these games use a downloadable app to streamline enemy AI, others come packed with a progressive narrative that offers more atmosphere and white-knuckle anxiety than the average Friday night round of Catan could ever deploy. Kang sees a symbiosis here, a world where board game designers and video game designers are each borrowing from the strengths of the other. \"Those lines are blending together,\" he says. \"I think it's eye-opening for developers and players.\" Let that be proof that the long cold war between PC gamers and tabletop gamers is finally over. Let us all enjoy a reality where ancient Pathfinder grognards, Gen Z Fortnite maestros, and unrepentant Crusader Kings lifers can exist as one. The equilibrium of geekdom has finally arrived.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Facebook developed what it calls a foundational “breakthrough” in the race to create more humanlike robots: software that enables machines to learn to walk like toddlers. Humans are very efficient at maneuvering. As kids, we figure out how to adjust our stride and cadence to trek through mud, water, and up and down hills with ease. Through trial and error, we adapt, figuring out the best ways to move our feet according to real-time situations. And we can do this while toting a variety of objects, either in our hands or on our backs.  It’s tough to program robots to make instantaneous adjustments to their legs and feet to accommodate such a variety of tasks, mainly because it’s hard to train them to deal with corner cases, or objects and environments they’ve never seen before. This is one of the main things AI struggles with today, said David Cox, IBM director of the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, a collaborative effort between IBM and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"How do you build systems that can adapt to all the corner cases they may see?” Advanced robot navigation could revolutionize services in a wide range of fields such as emergency response, agriculture, autonomous driving and manufacturing. It could hold the key to more complex chore robots. But it also requires teaching machines to act in the same way humans do subconsciously, based on lived experience — something that, at best, would be tedious and potentially impossible. Why it will be years before robot butlers take over your household chores Humans learn to navigate new environments by stumbling and trying again. But that’s an expensive and lengthy undertaking when applied to robots, which need to be fixed or have their code tweaked when damaged. Researchers try to avoid this by simulating new environments and adjusting robot brains accordingly. It’s a challenge Facebook says it has solved in collaboration with the University of California, Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon University.  First, researchers used simulations to train AI to respond to various environmental conditions, such as slippery ground or a sudden incline. Then, they taught a generic dog-like robot to learn from its mistakes and keep walking as far as possible despite sudden changes to its environment. They layered the two strategies, and together they “enable the robot to perform robust and adaptive locomotion without any fine tuning,” Facebook says. What this means is that AI allows them to adapt to factors in their environment without having seen them first. Rather than trying to avoid disruptions, they learn from surprises and move with them. Through the observation AI, each new leg movement is informed by previous ones. Obstacles that push against the robot’s feet or legs can reveal information about the ground around it. The AI learns from that. The so-called Rapid Motor Adaptation software might allow companies to create cheaper automated machines that figure out how to operate at peak performance with more affordable, not-as-accurate hardware. Cheaper robots are a critical step toward more advanced robots in more fields. Facebook showed off its AI development in a video. An eerie four-legged robot is shown pacing through the woods with relative ease. But when brought inside and tested in other situations, such as slippery surfaces, it had balance issues and difficulty walking. In one example, when weighted bags were placed on its back, the robot fell over. With Facebook’s AI software enabled, it wobbled but managed to stay upright and keep walking when the bags were tossed onto it. There are no cameras on the device. All of the robot’s movements were guided by sensors in its feet and various joints, which allow it to experience the world through “touch.”  Researchers compare it to what happens when humans try to walk on the sand at the beach for the first time. “The first few steps are awkward, but after a few steps, you’re walking on a beach as normally as you would on a hard road surface,” said Jitendra Malik, a computer vision researcher at Facebook AI and UC Berkeley. The team studied scientific literature on how children learn to walk to inform their project. Facebook isn’t the only big tech firm trying to create software that makes robots act more like real people. IBM, for instance, is researching AI methods that simulate raising a baby to understand what “common sense” knowledge a child gains, which can be applied to robotics. Last year, Google published a framework for wheeled robots to move through “unforeseen environments.” Boston Dynamics, a pioneer in agile, mobile robots, has a system on its Spot robots so they can “feel” the ground beneath them to try to avoid falling in low visibility. Facebook’s system was built on a $2,700 Unitree robot. Boston Dynamics’ Spot robot costs $74,500.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WAYNESBORO, Ga. — In the two months since Richard Watson strapped 200 remote-control-sized transmitters around his cows’ necks, an artificial-intelligence system named Ida has pinged his phone with helpful alerts: when his cows are chewing the cud, when they’re feeling sick, when they’re ready for insemination.  “There may be 10 animals out there that have a real problem, but could you pick them?” he said one morning, standing among a grazing herd of dairy cattle wearing what he calls “cow Fitbits.” But on neighboring pastures here in rural Georgia, other farmers say they aren’t that impressed. When a cow’s in heat, they know she’ll start getting mounted by her bovine sisters, so they apply a streak of paint on the cows’ backsides and then just look for the incriminating smudge. No fancy AI required. “I can spot a cow across a room that don’t feel great just by looking in her eyes,” said Mark Rodgers, a fourth-generation dairy farmer in Dearing, Ga., whose dad still drives a tractor at 82. “The good Lord said, ‘This is what you can do.’ I can’t draw, paint or anything else, but I can watch cows.”  Sophisticated AI technologies are helping reinvent how Americans work, offering powerful software that can read and react to mountains of data and save time and stress along the way. But the rollout is also sparking tensions in workplaces as humble and old-fashioned as the dairy farm. That down-home resistance raises a question farmers might be tackling before much of the rest of the workforce: Can new technology ever beat old intuition — even when it comes to a bunch of cows? The AI that Watson’s farm uses — called Ida, for “The Intelligent Dairy Farmer’s Assistant” — tracks his cows’ tiniest movements through their collars and then graphs and dissects them en masse. Those “real-time cattle analytics” are then used by the AI to assess diet and movement and predict health issues of concern, such as lameness or udder infections.  As silly as this intricate level of maximum optimization might sound, particularly in relation to a herd of cows that spend much of the day staring blankly or relieving themselves,Watson said, it could mean the difference between a cow’s healthy milking or premature death — and the difference between making or losing hundreds of thousands of dollars every year. The Ida AI has sparked some early interest among farmers eager to compete in an industry in which low milk prices and farm layoffs have everyone on edge. And while truck drivers and ­cashiers see AI as an omen of job elimination, the farmers say they’re in a labor crunch from years of too few young people getting into farming and need all the help they can get. Connecterra, a development team based in the Netherlands, built Ida with help from TensorFlow, the giant AI toolbox that Google created for its own apps and opened to the public in 2015. That release sparked a major wave of AI development, giving start-ups a shortcut to calculating advanced mathematics and creating learning machines.  Google has joined other tech giants in pushing forcefully into AI, with chief executive Sundar Pichai telling a town-hall crowd in January that AI “is one of the most important things humanity is working on” and “more profound than electricity or fire.” (He did not explicitly mention cows.) Standing one March morning among his cows at Seven Oaks Dairy, one of three farms he runs as part of his Hart Agriculture brand, Watson pulls out his iPhone to show off his Ida app. The AI says he has three “potential health problems to be checked” among his herd: Cow #14433 is eating less, while cows #10172 and #3522 are “ruminating,” or chewing, less, a sign they might feel ill. His herd’s cows “to be inseminated” count is at zero, as signified by a reassuring green check mark.  At 6-foot-4, with combine-wide shoulders and a Kiwi accent, the New Zealand-born Watson, 46, looks like a rugby player — which he was, playing a linebacker-like position in the late 1990s for a semiprofessional team called the Hurricanes. Shortly afterward, he moved to lead a cattle-grazing research program at the University of Georgia, where he taught and advocated for the increasingly rare practice of letting cows amble about aimlessly on a pasture, eating as they go. His farm’s cattle — crossbreeds of America’s classic black and white moo cow, the Holstein, and New Zealand’s relatively slimmer brown Jersey bulls — spend almost all day grazing on the thousands of acres of ryegrass and Bermuda grass on his farms. That makes tracking their free-range eating and movement harder than at the average American “confinement” dairy, where cows are kept in stalls and fattened on corn and grains. Spotting problems the old way required closely watching the herd day and night, “unless it’s really obvious — you know, she’s walking or limping or there are buzzards flying overhead,” Watson said. “Buzzards aren’t a particularly good health program.” The cows’ orange transmitters beam data over the hills of Watson’s pastures to a set of antennae near the milking parlor. A “base station” computer then gulps up and processes all that sensor data, doing much of the AI work locally to avoid the problem of spotty rural Internet service. The sensors the animals wear pay the price for much of this data exchange, Connecterra co-founder Yasir Khokhar said: “You don’t want to know what cows do with them.” The Ida AI was first trained to comprehend cow behavior via thousands of hours of video and sensor inputs, as well as simpler approaches, including Khokhar’s mimicking bovine techniques with a sensor in his pocket. (“I was the first cow,” he said.) Every day brings more cow data and farmer feedback that help the AI learn and improve.The AI, Khokhar estimates, has processed about “600 cow years of data” and gains about eight years of new cow data every day.  The AI now logs seven distinct cow behaviors: walking, standing, lying down, eating, chewing, drinking and idling. Other behaviors are on the way, Khokhar said, though he could not disclose them, calling them part of the “secret sauce.” Dairy farmers have used sensors for years. But Ida’s developers say its AI can do things old programs can’t, by learning from cow behavior patterns that can pinpoint injuries, predict the onset of certain diseases and “predict peak ovulation time with over 90 percent accuracy.” The AI can also track how changes to cows’ bedding, feed and environment can affect, for instance, how much milk they’re making or how much they’re lying around. Khokhar, who said he conceived the AI idea while living on a Dutch dairy farm, launched his start-up in late 2016 and counts a few thousand cow “subscriptions” on farms in seven countries, including the United States, Spain and Pakistan. The company covers all the equipment and service work and sells monthly subscriptions. Farmers’ prices start at about $3 a month per cow, plus a $79.99-per-cow start-up fee, and Watson estimates he has invested about $17,000 in the system so far.  Agriculture has long been one of Big Technology’s juiciest target industries. Revamping the way farmers feed the planet, in the face of existential crises such as food shortages and climate change, would be audacious, revolutionary — and highly profitable. Start-ups and farmers are using camera-equipped robots to pick apples and sort cucumbers, running driverless tractors to harvest grain, and flying scanner drones to spot poachers and survey livestock. Beyond the Ida collars, other tech start-ups make cow pedometers, robot milkers, tail sensors and electroshock collars that can stop or shift a herd. But even some farmers who have invested heavily in new technology balk at the idea of paying for more. Everett Williams, the 64-year-old head of the WDairy farm near Madison, Ga., said his farm has all kinds of sensors that print out who-knows-how-many reports on matters such as cow activity and whether wild hogs have gotten into his pens. They give him less data than the Ida AI would, he says, but he feels that he doesn’t have the space in his brain for another data stream. “You can only handle so many text alerts,” he said. Systems such as Connecterra also are enduring early criticism beyond the farm. Because AI can help detect early disorders and walking disabilities, conservationists have criticized the systems as encouraging the breeding of a super-cow by speeding underperformers to the slaughterhouse.  Rodgers, who runs his “daddy-daughter” family dairy farm in Dearing, Ga., said he’s no Luddite when it comes to farm technology. His “super-system” features cow-tracking transponders and, soon, a DeLaval VMS, which milks cows with laser-guided robot arms and is advertised as the “ultimate automatic milking machine.” His system, unlike Ida, doesn’t track cud-chewing or use AI to tell him which cows to watch or what to do. But he’s okay with that. That’s the way things have always been done here, and he hopes they’ll be that way for a long time. “There’s no substitute for watching your animals. It’s an art and a science, and I hope my daughter and nephew get better at it than I am,” he said. The cattle, he added, don’t care much about evolving with the times. “You cannot bore a cow to death.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Right now, most gaming news sites are busy putting together their mandatory 'most anticipated games of 2012' features – and most will include a title that looks nothing like anything else on the list. Journey. This desert-bound co-op adventure is the latest work from LA studio, thatgamecompany. Previously responsible for beautiful PlayStation experiments, Flow and Flower, the 12-person team has a unique approach to development, focusing on emotion and experience rather than conventional notions of design, challenge and structure.  The game's producer is Robin Hunicke, one of the most influential and inspiring figures on the US indie gaming scene. Starting out at Will Wright's Maxis studio she was a designer on Sims 2 and MySims before working on Steven Spielberg's BoomBlox puzzler. Now firmly ensconced at TGC, she's also a co-organiser of the Game Design Workshop and Experimental Gameplay Sessions at GDC and speaks at games festivals around the world. Her sessions at Nottingham's GameCity festival, which this year included a playthrough of Journey in the Old Market Square, have been among that wonderful event's highlights. Meanwhile, she's also currently completing a PhD in game design and AI. Recently, I got to chat to Hunicke about Journey, and about the future of interactive entertainment. Will artificial intelligence ever mean more that just effective path finding? And will games ever completely personalise their content to individual players? Hunicke was fascinating on all of this. Here's what she had to say. Starting your development career with a series like the Sims must have been a highly educational experience. What have been the lasting design lessons?Well, it had a huge fan site, and at the time that was really rare – you didn't really have social sites based around games. The Sims Exchange was a sort of strange phenomenon. That taught me how diverse a gaming audience can be. Also, my first experience of working in the games industry was at a studio that was well over 40% women – I was totally spoiled, I had no idea! The Sims was a completely different kind of game team at the time. I think now if you were to go and visit Zynga or one of the social games developers you would see that there's a similar mix, and a similar relationship with the players.  The development culture at thatgamecompany is very interesting, too. Is it true that you start out with an emotion that you want to explore or communicate through the game, and then you start on things like design and environment. Is that how Journey started?It is. Our approach is a combination of two things: the feeling that we want to communicate and create in the player, and then our own passions as developers.  So moving from Flower to Journey one of the things we really wanted to do was explore the online component. We'd never made an online game, we'd never made anything with a network backend. And also we'd never made a game with a character in it, so it was our first animated avatar! There were a lot of challenges – the simulated sand, the simulated cloth, all the animation systems – that's all new. We were really passionate about expanding our technical capabilities and learning as developers.  There's something very evocative about the desert, something immediately beguiling and mysterious. Is this why you chose it?One of the things we talked about early in the project was this idea of creating a connection between players in an environment where you feel small and less empowered than you might in a tradition video game setting. We thought this would be conducive to a feeling of wanting to spend time together. And we wanted to create this connection without forcing it – we don't make you play with someone else, but we chose the desert setting because we thought a desolate and unfriendly place might actually encourage a connection between players.  The desire to make the player feel small within the game environment is totally at odds with what most titles try to do. And in your previous titles, Flow and Flower, the player is almost obliterated entirely as a virtual entity. And yet your projects have proved popular with 'core' gamers. Why is that?I guess it's that we offer the same kind of craftsmanship, art and care that would be put in to a very high-end core game. I think if you play mainstream games, you will understand what the components are in Journey – it's just that they're put together in a different way. And if you're into video games then of course you'll be into new experiences, right?! The co-founder of thatgamecompany, Kellee Santiago, has spoken a little about this, but I'm interested in your angle: why is it important for your co-op partner in Journey to remain anonymous, even when the game ends?Well, there's a lot of pressure associated with performing socially, when we spend time together. When you go out to a bar and meet new people, the quality of the experience is really determined by how well you connect – there's so much that you see in each other from the moment that you meet.  If you see a person's online identity, if you hear their voice, if they send you text messages, you're getting a lot of information that might get in the way rather than facilitate the connection. So we wanted to see – as an experiment – if we could take away a lot of that noise, in the same way that the desert takes away noise from the visuals. The tactile experience of moving through that environment is quite different from, say, a cityscape with tons of buildings and doors and stairs. Similarly, not being able to talk to each another, you just have to be together… And does the game have a traditional narrative to it?There's a reason behind the world. We spent a lot of time talking about why everything exists, what it meant before and what it means now, because the world has a history and a backstory. But the narrative of Journey is about what you do in it – it's really hard to describe to someone who hasn't played it. It's a little bit like a mirror – the way you engage in the experience… you take something away from it because of who you are. If you want to follow someone you may, if you want to lead, you can lead. These things create the narrative of your own journey. That's what we wanted – we wanted to leave it up to the player, the individual.  That's intriguing, because I think it's a key question in modern game design. I wrote a feature earlier this year about Deus Ex and how much freedom you can really give to a player. How much do they want? Is this something you thought about while designing Journey?Yes, and actually Warren Spector [designer of Deus Ex], has always been a huge influence on me; we spent a long time talking about Journey when I was down at Fantastic Fest. He asked me the same thing: how much agency do I have in this setting?  It's a very interesting philosophical question. What would it be like if you could live the same life over and over again, and see the same things over and over, but with the ability to change them, like Groundhog Day? If you have a favourite hike you regularly go on, it's always the same, but yet also never the same. That is how Journey is attempting to be – like a place that you visit, and while you're there you experience yourself and other people, but it is effectively the same Journey. But then it isn't! Do you know what I mean? I do, but then I worry that modern game design orthodoxy is moving toward prescriptive narrative experiences and away from player agency and interpretation…It's expensive and difficult to find new things, to do systems engineering for tactile experiences, for nuanced gameplay. It takes a lot of time. What I talked about at GameCity was, well, why did Journey take us three years to develop? A lot of people would be hard-pressed to justify that sort of effort to a corporate entity. It's expensive and it takes a lot of energy.  We're a small studio, we can get by, but if you had 300 people doing that, it would become really scary. We stay small because we want to be able to experiment – that's the nature of what we do. It's like research. And we always wonder – will this be the one that doesn't work? But I think we're at the beginning of a trend – a lot of indie developers are doing things that are similarly exploratory. Whether or not they'll ever be as large as Call of Duty, I'm not sure. But maybe that doesn't matter.  But then, are indie games being experimental enough? I thought that, by now, we'd see a totally procedurally generated game, which creates unique landscapes, populates them with intelligent characters and leaves the rest up to the player. I actually think there's a real buzz about this in the community. I was at IndieCade recemtly, and Casey Reas, Robert Hodgin and Zach Gage all gave talks about procedurally generated environments and working with generated events and content. It was very exciting. I heard a lot of people talking about how they're going to start working on procedurally generated stuff – so you may get your wish in about five years! But there have been examples – Darwinia, Minecraft – it's happening, it's just that it's happening in isolated areas. Maybe there will be a procedurally generated killer app that'll just turn the whole industry in that direction.And maybe thatgamecompany will make it – you never know! Do you actually have a whole bunch of future projects written down somewhere at thatgamecompany or do you very much work on one thing at a time?No, we are a one-game studio. But we'll have conversations about what's happening in game design, so we're aware of the milieu that we exist in.  Journey has been such a long project – three years with a team of 12 people. Have there been any real screaming matches in the office?Every once in a while there'll be a very heated discussion. We're close to the end of the game now, so we've been talking a lot about the story and what Journey means. The last meeting we had was actually very constructive and polite – we've reached the point on the project where the things we're all passionate about are in the game. Now it's just a case of getting it done. That's the best part. It's always the middle of the project that's the most angsty! Something that's certainly happening right now is this idea of dynamic difficulty and procedural mission creation in games. We saw it with the AI director in Left 4 Dead and we're seeing it with the personal quests in Skyrim. That sounds like a move towards procedural generation.It does, and one of the things that excites me is thinking about how you can get so much data from a player, in the way that they move and choose things. If we spent more time paying attention to what they are really doing we would be able to create games that react in much more elaborate ways.  Thinking about a game that knows itself as a game, that engages you in the way that a human games master would is really fascinating. You could probably just attach procedural outcomes to the behaviours of other humans within the game, then you wouldn't have to simulate everything yourself; one of the things that happens with Journey is that players assume the other character is an AI, which is very flattering, because we could never program a robot to do the things that a player does with that avatar. But you get a similar kind of experience when you play it because they're not interrupting you with their own thoughts and needs – it really is a lot more like playing with the game, but the game is being puppeted by another person. I think that's an interesting area to explore – what kinds of interfaces do games create between people, and how do we as designers manipulate the signal that goes from one player to another?  A lot of games seem to stop at simply facilitating a relationship between gamers – providing voice chat, for example. Yes, and that technology is like 50 years old! It's crazy that we haven't moved beyond that.  The idea of games being aware that they're games is fascinating. They're usually just systems that are sort of plonked in front of the player. I like the idea of something sentient within the game, guiding and altering the experience…Have you played the Stanley Parable? It's really amazing, it's a narrative game, but it has a quality to it… I don't want to spoil it, but there is a quality to the design and the way that the developers approach the problem that's very much about, what if games were sentient? What if there was something about the narrator that goes beyond the voice that comes through the speakers? That's a really fruitful area to explore.  The other thing that's been happening lately is, some designers have been able to build environments in which the player is also able to create games. Glitch by Tiny Speck, for example. The game world itself is an excuse for people to participate in an event with each other. From there on, it's kind of Wild West – they want to see what happens in a world where players can alter the environment.  And building a world where players see the game as an interface between each other, it's like going back to board games, but through digital technology, which is really fascinating.  Yes, and one of the things we lost in the move from, say, paper-and-pencil role-playing games was being able to cheat the system, or come up with your own rules…Exactly! And that's the way people learn how to become game designers. The way that we all experience design is as children when we're playing street games or board games and we decide to change the rules to see what happens. Those kinds of instincts should be embraced rather than squished as we go through school; I expect we'll then see a lot more people ready to explore those possibilities with the technology they have.  You're just finishing a PhD on Artificial Intelligence aren't you? Yes, I was researching the AI system in Half-Life, which is like the AI director in Left 4 Dead but more primitive. I was fascinated by this idea of a program that changed itself based on what you did. If you look at Journey, you'll see that the design is taking part in an exchange with the machine. The computer is working with you to create this experience, it is mediating between you and the other player. People write to us at TGC and talk about how they've had these amazingly emotional experiences with Flower – people really fell in love with that program. And really, that's the goal, to develop a piece of software that creates a lasting connection with another person. But the problem with the way the games industry approaches AI is that its so prescriptive and functional – it's all about better path-finding and being able to flank the player in a shooting game…Well, the joy and the pain of working with robots, which I did at school, is that you quickly realise in order to get anything to work, you have to really simplify the universe. You paint a white line around the walls so they can follow it, you create a special system that lets them recognise corners… I did a lot of work with sonar early on. Then I just moved on to working with Half-Life because it was easier to program the in-game bots than it was to program real robots. But you quickly realise it's the same problem: you have to simplify the environment in order to bring about progress. And as a game developer, what happens is, you just get more and more objects in your world – everything can move, individual agents can move things – so now your planning has to be that much more complex. As environments become more dynamic, you're always on the treadmill of trying to solve the same problem. But yes, it would be nice if we also worked on new technologies using AI to create game play. Michael Mateas has a laboratory at UC Santa Cruz and the whole focus is to do procedurally generative design for art and games. He believes that if you work on procedural systems you can generate new kinds of games – but you can't do it the other way around; you can't think of those games then design the systems that will make them. I think that work is groundbreaking.  AI in games now is about simulating believability. If you want to simulate hidden information then you also have to simulate the suspicion of information, which is what most stealth games do. So if the player makes a noise, an AI enemy will say, 'hey, what was that?! I'm coming to investigate' and then you know to hide. It really is like an advanced game of tag, and you're just programming a tag bot – which is research that was done at CNU many, many years ago! It's strange how many of our fundamental game systems are pretty decrepit now…But at the same time, we build with what we know – that's what makes TGC such a special place. We could have made a forced co-op platform puzzler with really basic mechanics that were recognisable to the gaming community. But what we ended up doing was taking away everything that wasn't central to the thesis and then trying to design the systems that would make it feel great. Maybe that's not for everybody, but I wouldn't want to work in any other way. Journey will be released on PlayStation Network in spring, 2012.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The backlash against tech began in books. In the 2010s, when Google’s motto “Don’t be evil” felt unironic and TED talks lauding the Internet as the great social equalizer still drew credulous audiences, books such as Eli Pariser’s “The Filter Bubble” and Shoshana Zuboff’s “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism” were defining terms that would massively shift public opinion. Over the next decade, technology, or more specifically software, would come to be seen less as an innovative convenience and more as a harbinger of societal turmoil.  In 2022, anti-tech is mainstream. Ideas that originated in books about how platforms and their undergirding artificial-intelligence algorithms threaten society have made their way into Netflix documentaries, op-eds, bipartisan legislation and even the latest “Space Jam” (with supervillain Al-G Rhythm, played by Don Cheadle). Technology scholars such as Lina Khan and Meredith Whittaker, once considered fringe for their criticisms of technology’s structural harms, have found themselves with prominent appointments in the Biden administration. The world is finally listening to technology critics. So now the question is: What should they write about next? The easy answer is to ride the wave of tech’s new unpopularity, and that is the option NBC News tech correspondent Jacob Ward chose in writing “The Loop: How Technology Is Creating a World Without Choices and How to Fight Back.” The book argues that capitalistic AI technologies “prey on our psychological frailties” and threaten to create “a world in which our choices are narrowed, human agency is limited, and our worst unconscious impulses dominate society.” More than telling readers anything new about the dangers of technology, though, “The Loop” provides evidence that tech criticism itself is calcifying into a mainstream genre. The titular “loop” that Ward warns his readers about is rooted in the power, predictability and stupidity of our unconscious minds. When humans make decisions, our brains are quick to take shortcuts. In doing so, we make predictable, systematic errors such as miscalculating risk and overtrusting authority. Technology companies, Ward argues, use algorithms to hijack these unconscious patterns for profit. The “loop” is Ward’s speculation that our ever-increasing dependence on AI products — Spotify for music recommendations, social media algorithms for news, automated weapons for waging war — drives our thoughtlessness, which in turn makes us more dependent on AI, and so on. “In a generation or two,” Ward posits, “we’ll be an entirely different species — distracted, obedient, helpless to resist the technologies we use to make our choices for us, even when they’re the wrong choices.”  Throughout the book, Ward interviews technologists, academics and everyday users to understand how different AI products have become inextricably woven into people’s lives. In one section, he talks to people addicted to “social casino games,” free-to-play gambling simulators that lull users, often poor and in dark places in their lives, into spending tens of thousands of real dollars on in-game currency. In another, Ward rides along with police officers as they patrol a beat dictated by PredPol (now Geolitica), an infamously racially biased algorithm that predicts where crime will occur based on past incidents. Ward asks, “What happens when budgets and schedules for policing are built on the assumption that a software subscription can replace the need to pay overtime for detectives?” For people and institutions alike, once AI is introduced, it’s hard to remove. More often than not, though, Ward’s examples don’t fit into his neat conception of AI as a force for evil. Take his discussion of the 2017 incident aboard United Airlines Flight 3411 when security officers physically dragged David Dao, a physician, off an overbooked plane; he had refused to leave after being selected more or less randomly for involuntary removal. Ward describes Dao not as a victim of violently bad customer service but as an enlightened freedom fighter who stood strong against a dictatorial algorithm. “Everyone — from the flight attendants who insisted Dao change flights despite the consequences for his patients, to the young couple that got off when asked, to the officers summoned to remove Dao — was acting under the direction of a larger, mysterious machine.” Ward could have used the United incident to engage with hard questions about when algorithms should be used to make decisions and how those decisions should be communicated. Instead, he uses it as another opportunity to shake his fist at a computer that ruined everything. Ward rails with equal vigor against AI that demonstrably improves people’s lives. He interviews Yacqueline, a divorced woman who has trouble managing hostility against her ex as they negotiate time with their 5-year-old son. A judge orders that she and her former husband communicate through coParenter, a messaging app for divorced parents that uses AI to detect and mitigate hostile language. Yacqueline describes the app as a godsend, but Ward sees only danger. “Are Yacqueline and her ex modeling anything for [their son] at all, except the bland collegiality they’re reading line for line from a series of AI-driven prompts? . . . Is this training? Or are these training wheels that never come off?” Any evidence to the contrary, such as how Yacqueline never learned such conflict-management skills from her own, AI-less divorced parents, Ward ignores. “The Loop” has the right anecdotes to wrestle with the ethical ambiguity of AI, but instead it tries to prove that AI is, almost without exception, bad. Ward seems to have drawn the wrong lessons from the techlash authors who came before him: Rather than following their methods of considering from all angles and questioning the status quo, he rides the new status quo they helped establish. Today, the challenge of criticizing AI-driven capitalism and technology writ large is that it is hard to come up with an argument that readers whose brains have been sufficiently warped by the Internet couldn’t intuit themselves. Some recent books have stepped up to the challenge — Kate Crawford’s “Atlas of AI” and Logic Magazine’s recent four-book series on the tech industry, for example, shed new light on AI’s environmental impact and shady labor practices. But “The Loop,” like many books that set out to prove that technology is unequivocally bad, has little new to offer. Instead, it continues to clang the bell of anti-tech rabble-rousing, a sound we’ve all heard before and don’t need to hear again.

       "      <td>,Want to be first in line to preorder PlayStation 5? In a rare move for a console's launch, Sony has led the charge by announcing a direct-sales program—one that bypasses typical retail channels—before the upcoming system's price, release date, or other details have been announced. This story originally appeared on, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Condé Nast. Starting Wednesday, prospective buyers can go to Sony's official preorder site to express their interest in purchasing a PS5. Users only need to enter one piece of information into the form: their PlayStation Network ID. And ... that's it. From there, Sony will determine exactly who will be deigned worthy of a shot at purchasing a PS5, and this will be based on \"previous interests and PlayStation activities.\" Exactly what that information is, and how it will be weighted, is currently unclear. Years of membership? Number of games owned? Whether the account in question pays for subscription services like PlayStation Plus or PlayStation Now, or merely uses a wholly free PSN account? Sony has yet to clarify this point. If you've been selected as part of Sony's direct preorder program, you'll find out at some point (currently unknown) via an email sent to the address registered to your PSN account. (Hence, today would be a good day to double-check that address and other PSN profile information.) If you didn't get into Sony's preorder program, you won't receive the bad news in the form of an email or any other notification. And while PSN IDs from all over the world will be eligible for this program, orders will only work if they ship to US addresses. It's unclear whether Sony will roll out similar campaigns for other territories. With that email, you'll be told the exact time window you have to place an order of a PS5 console, which can either be the standard version (with a disc drive) or the \"Digital Version\" (no disc drive). Sony has emphasized a limit of one PS5 console per PSN ID. Invited PSN users will also be able to directly order PS5 peripherals with their console, including DualSense controllers, headsets, cameras, media remotes, and controller charging stands. No peripheral bundle will be forced upon buyers in Sony's direct-sales program. Sony's language implies, but doesn't quite confirm, that this PSN-related program will be the very first one in the world to offer PS5 console preorders. Meaning, Sony may beat typical retailers like Gamestop, Amazon, and Best Buy to the preorder party. It's another major blow to the usual retailer product chain, which was already disrupted by Sony giving fans the option of punting discs with the Digital Edition and buying all their games directly from PlayStation Network. We're still waiting to hear exactly how much the console will cost and when it will begin shipping to customers and retailers, but other crucial details remain unanswered before a program like this rolls out. How much will all of PS5's peripherals cost—particularly the brand-new DualSense controller, which looks bulkier and adds more sensitive functions (particularly its haptic feedback system) than any previous first-party PlayStation gamepad? What kind of built-in capacity should we expect for the PS5's solid-state drive, and what requirements should we expect for add-on NVMe drives?\\nWhich previously announced games will launch alongside the console? (So far, we only know about Spider-man: Miles Morales as a first-party PS5 game for 2020, but whether it will accompany the console's launch is still unknown. Comparatively, Microsoft originally announced Halo Infinite as a launch title for this year's Xbox Series X, only to pull back.) Most of all, will fans know the price before this preorder program goes live, or will interested buyers have mere milliseconds to swallow the price tag before placing their preorder amongst a crazed mob of specially selected PSN users? Sony likely isn't incentivized to let anyone mull the price tag, considering how high we expect it will be—and third-party game publishers are already revving fans' wallets in the form of higher next-gen game prices.

       "      <td>Delirious, deranged, gonzo or just gone, baby, gone  no single adjective or even a pileup does justice to “House,” a 1977 Japanese haunted-house freakout. Directed by Nobuhiko Obayashi, this energetic exemplar of pulp surrealism began surfacing in the United States last year, playing at events like the New York Asian Film Festival. Now, in advance of the Criterion DVD, which will be released later this year, it is receiving its first, must-see-now domestic theatrical run at the IFC Center in New York. A midnight movie in lysergic spirit and vibe, this was a film made for late-night screening and screaming. The yelps you’ll hear and possibly emit, though, will be of surprise and delight, not terror. “House,” which turns on a misbegotten, increasingly violent trip taken by seven teenage girls, is not in the least scary, despite its body count and gore. If the hairs on your neck snap to attention, it will be only because of Mr. Obayashi’s flamboyant visual style, his comic flights of fancy and genre manipulations. This might be about a haunted house, but it’s the film that is more truly possessed: in one scene a piano bites off the fingers of a musician tickling its keys; in another a severed head tries to take a bite out of a girl’s rear, snapping at the derrière as if it were an apple. Later a roomful of futons goes on the attack. The decapitated noggin also flies through the air, but that’s getting, um, ahead of the story, which opens with two uniformed teenage girls putting on a little photo shoot, prettily posing and laughing. You quickly discover that one, who’s known as Gorgeous (Kimiko Ikegami), a moniker used by both her friends and father (Saho Sasazawa), is the center from which all the other chaotic parts flow and twist. Although she seems like a model daughter (her insistent smile could light up Tokyo or at least a toothpaste commercial), she churns with jealousy after her father introduces her to his new girlfriend, Ryoko (Haruko Wanibuchi), another wide-smiling beauty whose lightly billowing hair and clothes suggest that she keeps company with an off-screen wind machine. In a bid to get away from home, Gorgeous decides to visit her dead mother’s sister (Yoko Minamida). The aunt agrees in a letter that arrives, partly or so it seems, with the help of a white cat that inexplicably materializes one day. Gorgeous enlists six of her friends as accompaniment, a giggling retinue of nymphs fancifully named Sweet, Melody, Fantasy, Prof, Mac and Kung Fu. Traveling by train, wheels and foot, they arrive at an isolated house, where the aunt, who’s in a wheelchair (if not for long!), lives with her white cat, whose eyes beam out ominous green sparks and who has been immortalized in artwork throughout the house. Things soon start to go very badly for the teenagers. It’s easy to track the plot points in “House” and rather more difficult to grasp why Mr. Obayashi tells the story the way he does, to gauge the significance of the gaudy colors, the old-fashioned techniques (he periodically irises up and down), the superimpositions and flurries of jump cuts. The exterior backdrops tend to be overtly artificial, the skies so streaked with orange that you half expect to see Scarlett O’Hara shaking her fist at the heavens. A scene with Gorgeous, her father and his new squeeze, meanwhile, is shot through a multipaned window that separates the camera (and us) from the characters, one of several such distancing strategies. There are close-ups, but many are so glossy and stylized that they look like advertisements. Some of these flourishes seem to express the interior states of the characters: the wind that gently stirs Ryoko’s hair and clothes whenever she steps in front of the camera suggests that she imagines herself as a kind of romantic figure. Similarly, the gauzy shot of a dreamy-looking girl playing the piano implies that she, too, sees herself in flattering soft focus. Then again, these visual fillips also bring to mind a story that the actor Bill Duke once told about working with the director Samuel Fuller. Mr. Duke asked Fuller why the camera was pointing up from beneath a glass table. Whose point of view is that? Mr. Duke wondered. It’s my point of view, Fuller responded, asserting his directorial prerogative. “House” was Mr. Obayashi’s first feature, and at times it feels as if he threw everything  every movie he had ever seen, every idea he had ever entertained  at the screen, using the horror genre as a big box into which he could combine the bits and pieces he wanted to sample from avant-garde cinema, Looney Tunes cartoons, schlock Italian horror and martial arts movies. One of the most arresting sequences, featuring pinwheeling female body parts, brings to mind various Surrealist collages and that movement’s representations of dismembered female forms. (One of Mr. Obayashi’s many features is “Sada,” a 1998 version of the same obsessive love story in Nagisa Oshima’s 1976 “In the Realm of the Senses,” about a woman who severs her lover’s penis.) Not much has been published in English on Mr. Obayashi, though there’s a useful overview of his life and work by Paul Roquet at midnighteye.com. Mr. Obayashi was born in 1938 and started making experimental films in his 20s, becoming involved in the 1960s with an art group whose members included Yoko Ono, before going on to a prolific career as a director of commercials. The press notes for “House” state that the story originated from the “eccentric musings” of his 11-year-old daughter, a nice, perverse touch. Whether “House” was her fantasy or his, Mr. Obayashi has created a true fever dream of a film, one in which the young female imagination  that of his daughter, Gorgeous or both  yields memorable results. HOUSE Opens on Friday in Manhattan. Produced and directed by Nobuhiko Obayashi; written by Chiho Katsura, based on a concept by Chigumi Obayashi; director of photography, Yoshitaka Sakamoto; music by Asei Kobayashi and Mickie Yoshino, performed by Godiego; production designer, Kazuo Satsuya; released by Janus Films.

       "      <td>Hewlett-Packard just announced a new line of business computers. They include sensors in the racks and wires, and smart software. Perhaps it should also include a small prayer that its customers do not change too much                                         or too fast. The new machines, the ProLiant Generation 8 servers, are the product of two years of development costing $300 million. The company claims the machines have over 160 different upgrades and new features compared with                                         H.P.’s previous generation of servers, including things like automated updating of security patches that can cut server re-provisioning times to 10 minutes from 5 hours. Sensors in the server racks can tell                                         where machines are located and how they are performing. Performance tweaks yield 70 percent more computing power per watt, H.P. says. Fewer humans and more software, the company claims, can cut server downtime by                                         up to 93 percent. These are all changes that speak to the big concerns corporate buyers have about their growing computer systems: how can they keep track of things, afford the power demands, and keep this many densely packed semiconductors                                         from melting down under the heat they collectively generate? H.P. is also selling how much these systems can save on manpower costs, with much of the maintenance automated. (The computers can even send care messages                                         to H.P.’s resellers.) Companies may be able to unload staff members, but H.P. hopes they keep the machines themselves. After all, H.P. is a company with over $130 billion in annual revenues, and a good portion of that comes from having its                                         machines inside corporate data centers. If companies move to cloud systems, particularly clouds in which operators buy machines and equipment directly from cheaper suppliers like Flextronics, or Taiwan’s                                         Quanta, then H.P. has worries. Clouds are volume buys, meaning H.P. will have to compete at a lower profit margin. Jim Ganthier, H.P.’s vice president for server marketing, said his company was confident there is still a long future ahead for computing on premises. “Ultimately, it will all be a hybrid,” he said.                                         Corporate tech buyers “are smart folks,” he said. “They’ll vote for the team that will help them best.” In the long run, he said, the new line is also well-suited for cloud computing. H.P. is not just looking to hold onto individual sales to business. The software that tells resellers, powerful sales allies for H.P., when they need to service computers will help those resellers persuade their customers                                         to keep buying machines — and not move too fast to cloud computing. We’ll see if that works. This server upgrade, called Project Voyager, follows an announcement in November of Project Moonshot, which employs low-power cellphone chips to power servers in big data centers. (You don’t need to be a rocket                                         scientist to figure out that H.P. is naming all of its server programs after famous NASA programs.) A sales line announced in December, called Project Odyssey, allowed popular operating systems to be used in highly                                         demanding computing situations.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Wealth and influence in the technology business have always been about gaining the upper hand in software or the machines that software ran on. Now data — gathered in those immense pools of information that are at the heart of everything from artificial intelligence to online shopping recommendations — is increasingly a focus of technology competition. And academics and some policy makers, especially in Europe, are considering whether big internet companies like Google and Facebook might use their data resources as a barrier to new entrants and innovation. In recent years, Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft have all been targets of tax evasion, privacy or antitrust investigations. But in the coming years, who controls what data could be the next worldwide regulatory focus as governments strain to understand and sometimes rein in American tech giants. The European Commission and the British House of Lords both issued reports last year on digital “platform” companies that highlighted the essential role that data collection, analysis and distribution play in creating and shaping markets. And the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development held a meeting in November to explore the subject, “Big Data: Bringing Competition Policy to the Digital Era.” As government regulators dig into this new era of data competition, they may find that standard antitrust arguments are not so easy to make. Using more and more data to improve a service for users and more accurately target ads for merchants is a clear benefit, for example. And higher prices for consumers are not present with free internet services. “You certainly don’t want to punish companies because of what they might do,” said Annabelle Gawer, a professor of the digital economy at the University of Surrey in England, who made a presentation at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development meeting. “But you do need to be vigilant. It’s clear that enormous power is in the hands of a few companies.” Maurice Stucke, a former Justice Department antitrust official and a professor at the University of Tennessee College of Law, who also spoke at the gathering, said one danger was that consumers might be afforded less privacy than they would choose in a more competitive market. The competition concerns echo those that gradually emerged in the 1990s about software and Microsoft. The worry is that as the big internet companies attract more users and advertisers, and gather more data, a powerful “network effect” effectively prevents users and advertisers from moving away from a dominant digital platform, like Google in search or Facebook in consumer social networks. Evidence of the rising importance of data can be seen from the frontiers of artificial intelligence to mainstream business software. And certain data sets can be remarkably valuable for companies working on those technologies. A prime example is Microsoft’s purchase of LinkedIn, the business social network, for $26.2 billion last year. LinkedIn has about 467 million members, and it houses their profiles and maps their connections. Microsoft is betting LinkedIn, combined with data on how hundreds of millions of workers use its Office 365 online software, and consumer data from search behavior on Bing, will “power a set of insights that we think is unprecedented,” said James Phillips, vice president for business applications at Microsoft. In an email to employees, Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, described the LinkedIn deal as a linchpin in the company’s long-term goal to “reinvent productivity and business processes” and to become the digital marketplace that defines “how people find jobs, build skills, sell, market and get work done.” IBM has also bet heavily on data for its future. Its acquisitions have tended to be in specific industries, like its $2.6 billion purchase last year of Truven Health, which has data on the cost and treatment of more than 200 million patients, or in specialized data sets useful across several industries, like its $2 billion acquisition of the digital assets of the Weather Company. IBM estimates that 70 percent of the world’s data is not out on the public web, but in private databases, often to protect privacy or trade secrets. IBM’s strategy is to take the data it has acquired, add customer data and use that to train its Watson artificial intelligence software to pursue such tasks as helping medical researchers discover novel disease therapies, or flagging suspect financial transactions for independent auditors. “Our focus is mainly on nonpublic data sets and extending that advantage for clients in business and science,” said David Kenny, senior vice president for IBM’s Watson and cloud businesses. At Google, the company’s drive into cloud-delivered business software is fueled by data, building on years of work done on its search and other consumer services, and its recent advances in image identification, speech recognition and language translation. For example, a new Google business offering — still in the test, or alpha, stage — is a software service to improve job finding and recruiting. Its data includes more than 17 million online job postings and the public profiles and résumés of more than 200 million people. Its machine-learning algorithms distilled that to about four million unique job titles, ranked the most common ones and identified specific skills. The job sites CareerBuilder and Dice are using the Google technology to show job seekers more relevant openings. And FedEx, the giant package shipper, is adding the service to its recruiting site. That is just one case, said Diane Greene, senior vice president for Google’s cloud business, of what is becoming increasingly possible — using the tools of artificial intelligence, notably machine learning, to sift through huge quantities of data to provide machine-curated data services. “You can turn this technology to whatever field you want, from manufacturing to medicine,” Ms. Greene said. Fei-Fei Li, director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, is taking a sabbatical to become chief scientist for artificial intelligence at Google’s cloud unit. She sees working at Google as one path to pursue her career ambition to “democratize A.I.,” now that the software and data ingredients are ripe. “We wouldn’t have the current era of A.I. without the big data revolution,” Dr. Li said. “It’s the digital gold.” In the A.I. race, better software algorithms can put you ahead for a year or so, but probably no more, said Andrew Ng, a former Google scientist and adjunct professor at Stanford. He is now chief scientist at Baidu, the Chinese internet search giant, and a leading figure in artificial intelligence research. Rivals, he added, cannot unlock or simulate your data. “Data is the defensible barrier, not algorithms,” Mr. Ng said.</td>\n",

Mo Zhou was snapped up by I.B.M. last summer, as a freshly minted Yale M.B.A., to join the technology company’s fast-growing ranks of data consultants. They help businesses make sense of an explosion of data — Web traffic and social network comments, as well as software and sensors that monitor shipments, suppliers and customers — to guide decisions, trim costs and lift sales. “I’ve always had a love of numbers,” says Ms. Zhou, whose job as a data analyst suits her skills. To exploit the data flood, America will need many more like her. A report last year by the McKinsey Global Institute, the research arm of the consulting firm, projected that the United States needs 140,000 to 190,000 more workers with “deep analytical” expertise and 1.5 million more data-literate managers, whether retrained or hired. The impact of data abundance extends well beyond business. Justin Grimmer, for example, is one of the new breed of political scientists. A 28-year-old assistant professor at Stanford, he combined math with political science in his undergraduate and graduate studies, seeing “an opportunity because the discipline is becoming increasingly data-intensive.” His research involves the computer-automated analysis of blog postings, Congressional speeches and press releases, and news articles, looking for insights into how political ideas spread. The story is similar in fields as varied as science and sports, advertising and public health — a drift toward data-driven discovery and decision-making. “It’s a revolution,” says Gary King, director of Harvard’s Institute for Quantitative Social Science. “We’re really just getting under way. But the march of quantification, made possible by enormous new sources of data, will sweep through academia, business and government. There is no area that is going to be untouched.” Welcome to the Age of Big Data. The new megarich of Silicon Valley, first at Google and now Facebook, are masters at harnessing the data of the Web — online searches, posts and messages — with Internet advertising. At the World Economic Forum last month in Davos, Switzerland, Big Data was a marquee topic. A report by the forum, “Big Data, Big Impact,” declared data a new class of economic asset, like currency or gold. Rick Smolan, creator of the “Day in the Life” photography series, is planning a project later this year, “The Human Face of Big Data,” documenting the collection and uses of data. Mr. Smolan is an enthusiast, saying that Big Data has the potential to be “humanity’s dashboard,” an intelligent tool that can help combat poverty, crime and pollution. Privacy advocates take a dim view, warning that Big Data is Big Brother, in corporate clothing. What is Big Data? A meme and a marketing term, for sure, but also shorthand for advancing trends in technology that open the door to a new approach to understanding the world and making decisions. There is a lot more data, all the time, growing at 50 percent a year, or more than doubling every two years, estimates IDC, a technology research firm. It’s not just more streams of data, but entirely new ones. For example, there are now countless digital sensors worldwide in industrial equipment, automobiles, electrical meters and shipping crates. They can measure and communicate location, movement, vibration, temperature, humidity, even chemical changes in the air. Link these communicating sensors to computing intelligence and you see the rise of what is called the Internet of Things or the Industrial Internet. Improved access to information is also fueling the Big Data trend. For example, government data — employment figures and other information — has been steadily migrating onto the Web. In 2009, Washington opened the data doors further by starting Data.gov, a Web site that makes all kinds of government data accessible to the public. Data is not only becoming more available but also more understandable to computers. Most of the Big Data surge is data in the wild — unruly stuff like words, images and video on the Web and those streams of sensor data. It is called unstructured data and is not typically grist for traditional databases. But the computer tools for gleaning knowledge and insights from the Internet era’s vast trove of unstructured data are fast gaining ground. At the forefront are the rapidly advancing techniques of artificial intelligence like natural-language processing, pattern recognition and machine learning. Those artificial-intelligence technologies can be applied in many fields. For example, Google’s search and ad business and its experimental robot cars, which have navigated thousands of miles of California roads, both use a bundle of artificial-intelligence tricks. Both are daunting Big Data challenges, parsing vast quantities of data and making decisions instantaneously. The wealth of new data, in turn, accelerates advances in computing — a virtuous circle of Big Data. Machine-learning algorithms, for example, learn on data, and the more data, the more the machines learn. Take Siri, the talking, question-answering application in iPhones, which Apple introduced last fall. Its origins go back to a Pentagon research project that was then spun off as a Silicon Valley start-up. Apple bought Siri in 2010, and kept feeding it more data. Now, with people supplying millions of questions, Siri is becoming an increasingly adept personal assistant, offering reminders, weather reports, restaurant suggestions and answers to an expanding universe of questions. To grasp the potential impact of Big Data, look to the microscope, says Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management. The microscope, invented four centuries ago, allowed people to see and measure things as never before — at the cellular level. It was a revolution in measurement. Data measurement, Professor Brynjolfsson explains, is the modern equivalent of the microscope. Google searches, Facebook posts and Twitter messages, for example, make it possible to measure behavior and sentiment in fine detail and as it happens. In business, economics and other fields, Professor Brynjolfsson says, decisions will increasingly be based on data and analysis rather than on experience and intuition. “We can start being a lot more scientific,” he observes. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence of the payoff from data-first thinking. The best-known is still “Moneyball,” the 2003 book by Michael Lewis, chronicling how the low-budget Oakland A’s massaged data and arcane baseball statistics to spot undervalued players. Heavy data analysis had become standard not only in baseball but also in other sports, including English soccer, well before last year’s movie version of “Moneyball,” starring Brad Pitt. Retailers, like Walmart and Kohl’s, analyze sales, pricing and economic, demographic and weather data to tailor product selections at particular stores and determine the timing of price markdowns. Shipping companies, like U.P.S., mine data on truck delivery times and traffic patterns to fine-tune routing. Online dating services, like Match.com, constantly sift through their Web listings of personal characteristics, reactions and communications to improve the algorithms for matching men and women on dates. Police departments across the country, led by New York’s, use computerized mapping and analysis of variables like historical arrest patterns, paydays, sporting events, rainfall and holidays to try to predict likely crime “hot spots” and deploy officers there in advance. Research by Professor Brynjolfsson and two other colleagues, published last year, suggests that data-guided management is spreading across corporate America and starting to pay off. They studied 179 large companies and found that those adopting “data-driven decision making” achieved productivity gains that were 5 percent to 6 percent higher than other factors could explain. The predictive power of Big Data is being explored — and shows promise — in fields like public health, economic development and economic forecasting. Researchers have found a spike in Google search requests for terms like “flu symptoms” and “flu treatments” a couple of weeks before there is an increase in flu patients coming to hospital emergency rooms in a region (and emergency room reports usually lag behind visits by two weeks or so). Global Pulse, a new initiative by the United Nations, wants to leverage Big Data for global development. The group will conduct so-called sentiment analysis of messages in social networks and text messages — using natural-language deciphering software — to help predict job losses, spending reductions or disease outbreaks in a given region. The goal is to use digital early-warning signals to guide assistance programs in advance to, for example, prevent a region from slipping back into poverty. In economic forecasting, research has shown that trends in increasing or decreasing volumes of housing-related search queries in Google are a more accurate predictor of house sales in the next quarter than the forecasts of real estate economists. The Federal Reserve, among others, has taken notice. In July, the National Bureau of Economic Research is holding a workshop on “Opportunities in Big Data” and its implications for the economics profession. Big Data is already transforming the study of how social networks function. In the 1960s, Stanley Milgram of Harvard used packages as his research medium in a famous experiment in social connections. He sent packages to volunteers in the Midwest, instructing them to get the packages to strangers in Boston, but not directly; participants could mail a package only to someone they knew. The average number of times a package changed hands was remarkably few, about six. It was a classic demonstration of the “small-world phenomenon,” captured in the popular phrase “six degrees of separation.” Today, social-network research involves mining huge digital data sets of collective behavior online. Among the findings: people whom you know but don’t communicate with often — “weak ties,” in sociology — are the best sources of tips about job openings. They travel in slightly different social worlds than close friends, so they see opportunities you and your best friends do not. Researchers can see patterns of influence and peaks in communication on a subject — by following trending hashtags on Twitter, for example. The online fishbowl is a window into the real-time behavior of huge numbers of people. “I look for hot spots in the data, an outbreak of activity that I need to understand,” says Jon Kleinberg, a professor at Cornell. “It’s something you can only do with Big Data.” Big Data has its perils, to be sure. With huge data sets and fine-grained measurement, statisticians and computer scientists note, there is increased risk of “false discoveries.” The trouble with seeking a meaningful needle in massive haystacks of data, says Trevor Hastie, a statistics professor at Stanford, is that “many bits of straw look like needles.” Big Data also supplies more raw material for statistical shenanigans and biased fact-finding excursions. It offers a high-tech twist on an old trick: I know the facts, now let’s find ’em. That is, says Rebecca Goldin, a mathematician at George Mason University, “one of the most pernicious uses of data.” Data is tamed and understood using computer and mathematical models. These models, like metaphors in literature, are explanatory simplifications. They are useful for understanding, but they have their limits. A model might spot a correlation and draw a statistical inference that is unfair or discriminatory, based on online searches, affecting the products, bank loans and health insurance a person is offered, privacy advocates warn. Despite the caveats, there seems to be no turning back. Data is in the driver’s seat. It’s there, it’s useful and it’s valuable, even hip. Veteran data analysts tell of friends who were long bored by discussions of their work but now are suddenly curious. “Moneyball” helped, they say, but things have gone way beyond that. “The culture has changed,” says Andrew Gelman, a statistician and political scientist at Columbia University. “There is this idea that numbers and statistics are interesting and fun. It’s cool now.”</td>\n",

games give players more freedom to explore complex digital worlds, it becomes more challenging for a CG character to naturally move and interact with everything in it. So to prevent those awkward transitions between pre-programmed movements, researchers have turned to AI and deep learning to make video game characters move almost as realistically as real humans do. To help make video game characters walk, run, jump, and perform other movements as realistically as possible, video game developers will often rely on human performances that are captured and translated to digital characters. It produces results that are faster and better looking than animating video game characters by hand, but it’s impossible to plan for every possible way a character will interact with a digital world, according to the researchers. Game developers try to plan for as many possibilities as they can, but they ultimately have to rely on software to transition between animations of a character walking up to a chair, and then sitting down on it, and more often than not, those segues feel stilted, unnatural, and can diminish a player’s experience. Computer scientists from the University of Edinburgh and Adobe Research have come up with a novel solution they’ll be presenting at the ACM Siggraph Asia conference being held in Brisbane, Australia, next month. And like many breakthroughs that have come before it, it involves leveraging the capabilities of deep learning neural networks to smooth over the animation hiccups that video games currently exhibit. To create the convincing but unsettling deepfake videos you’ll find all over the internet now, a neural network is first trained by studying a given person’s face (often a celebrity) from every possible angle and with every imaginable expression using a database of tens of thousands of headshots of the subject. It’s a time consuming process, but with that knowledge, face swaps can be automatically created that look impossibly lifelike. Run it outA watch that is highly durable in the event you fall over, lets you know if you’re over or under training based on your performance, can help you create custom workouts, and gives you all the stats you could ever want. A similar approach is being taken for this research, but instead of training a neural network on a database of faces, it studies a collection of motions captured and digitized from a live performer on a soundstage. For the best results, it does require a fairly large database of motions for the system to analyze, with a performer going through the motions of picking up objects, climbing over things, or plopping down in a chair. But it doesn’t have to be infinitely inclusive, the neural network can take what it’s learned and adapt it to almost any situation or environment, while still producing natural looking results and movements, according to the researchers. It’s filling in the gaps between a character walking up to a chair, slowing down, turning their body, and then sitting, but intelligently linking all of those movements and animations together to hide the seams. There are other advantages to teaching video games how characters should move and interact with things instead of pre-animating those motions, such as helping to reduce the file sizes of games and the amount of data that has to be processed and shared: something that will become even more relevant as streaming games becomes more and more prevalent. This approach also paves the way for more complex interactions for video game characters. How often do you see more than two characters end up fighting each other? Never, except in pre-animated cut scenes. The next version of Red Dead Redemption could finally include real barroom brawls.   \n",

    Jay-Z’s company Roc Nation have filed takedown notices against “deepfake” videos that use artificial intelligence to make him rap Billy Joel’s We Didn’t Start the Fire and Hamlet’s “To be or not to be” soliloquy. The anonymous creator of the YouTube-hosted videos, known as Vocal Synthesis, has said that copyright notices were filed by Roc Nation, stating: “This content unlawfully uses an AI to impersonate our client’s voice.” The two aforementioned videos have been removed, though others remain, including one of the rapper taking on the Book of Genesis. Vocal Synthesis said – via a deepfake video using the ersatz voices of Barack Obama and Donald Trump – that they had “no malicious purpose” and were “disappointed that Jay-Z and Roc Nation have decided to bully a small YouTuber in this way”. The Guardian has contacted Roc Nation for comment. Deepfake videos have already caused great controversy in political and celebrity circles, with California outlawing them in 2018, and Facebook banning them in January. The technology has most notoriously been used to create fake pornographic videos featuring famous actors – the PornHub website banned deepfakes in 2018. Deepfakes differ from so-called “cheapfakes”, which don’t involve AI and instead feature re-edited footage with the aim of distorting the truth. Famous examples include a video of Nancy Pelosi doctored to make her look drunk, and one of Keir Starmer created by the Tory party for social media where he appeared unable to answer a question. Posting on Twitter this week, Donald Trump shared a fake gif of Joe Biden sticking his tongue out. There are debates over the copyright implications of AI-created videos such as the Jay-Z performances, with digital access advocates Creative Commons arguing: “It is ill-advised to force the application of the copyright system – an antiquated system that has yet to adapt to the digital environment – on to AI.”   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         IBM is cutting the pay of some employees in its services business by 10 percent for six months while they spend up to one day a week in training programs. The move is unusual, according to work-force experts, but could become a trend in retraining programs as both corporations and workers struggle to stay competitive in a fast-changing economy. Some disgruntled IBM employees                                         say the step is a cost-cutting tactic disguised as a training program. IBM says the program is limited to a small number of employees and is meant to avoid laying them off. Last Friday, some workers in the company’s outsourcing business received emails informing them of the program. It stated that “a recent assessment” had identified workers who “have not kept                                         pace with acquiring the skills and expertise needed to address changing client needs, technology and market requirements.” The email then added, “You have been identified as one of these employees,”                                         according to a copy sent to The New York Times by an IBM worker. The training is intended to take about a day a week, up to a total of 23 days. During that time, the email stated, “you will receive 90 percent of your current base salary.” Employees receiving the offer are given little choice, other than to look elsewhere in the company “for opportunities for which your skills may be a better match.” The IBM program was reported on Monday by Computerworld. A spokeswoman for IBM, Trink Guarino, emphasized that the salary cut-and-retraining program was by no means standard practice across the company. A few hundred people in the technology services outsourcing business                                         in the United States, she said, were affected. “This involves a very small number of people,” Ms. Guarino said, “and we’re working to preserve their jobs.” The technology marketplace is shifting quickly, Ms. Guarino noted, as corporate customers move to adopt cloud and mobile computing, and advanced data analysis. The training programs will focus on those areas, she said. The workers are in the IBM business unit that manages technology operations for other companies, in long-term outsourcing contracts that typically extend for five or more years. The IBM workers log billable hours, and                                         if they spend a day a week on training, that amounts to 20 percent fewer billable hours. IBM regards the 10 percent salary cuts as a form of “co-investment” with the cost shared by workers and the                                         company. Some IBM workers don’t see it that way. One person who has worked for IBM for more than 20 years said that the skills assessment referred to in the email was not tailored to individuals. All the workers in his                                         group, he said, were being assigned the same training program. He noted that the Indian workers who were part of the same team doing similar work for the same client were not involved. “It seems like a cost-cutting exercise that is being presented as a training program,” said the IBM worker, who asked not to be identified because he feared consequences for criticizing the company. A crucial issue, according to Peter Cappelli, a professor at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, is the nature of the training in the IBM program. “If the skills they are learning                                         are useful outside of IBM, it may be a pretty good deal for the workers,” he said. “If not, it just looks like cost cutting.” Mr. Cappelli, director of Wharton’s Center for Human Resources, said that the concept of co-investing, with the costs shared by workers and companies, is “where we are going to end up going in retraining.”                                         Already, employees and companies routinely split the tuition costs for workers who choose to take college courses to improve their skills. However, he added, the tuition programs are different from the IBM initiative in that they are voluntary, with both worker and company choosing to make contributions. “This one seems rougher,” Mr. Cappelli said, “because the company is forcing you to take a pay cut.”    \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Disheveled, eyes bruised with fatigue, and feeling grungy after two days of showerless toil, 190 video game designers, artists and programmers disembarked on Saturday afternoon from the rain-slicked California Zephyr at the Emeryville, Calif., Amtrak station. The travelers — some of whom had come from as far away as Zambia and Pakistan — had taken part in Train Jam, which uses the trip from Chicago to this city just north of Oakland as both an opportunity and a time frame for strangers to come together and, amid laptops, headphones and virtual-reality headsets, create video games. “You will never know true happiness until you’ve showered after a 52-hour-long train ride,” Adriel Wallick, the event’s organizer, wrote on Twitter after arriving in the Bay Area. Ms. Wallick, 29, an independent game developer from the Netherlands, conceived Train Jam as a way of making a creative venture out of the journey to the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, the world’s largest annual gathering of game makers. Ms. Wallick said the idea came to her during a trip from Boston to Seattle three years ago: “I realized that a cross-country train ride would work perfectly as a game jam,” she said, referring to the increasingly prevalent events in which participants develop video games over an allotted time period. And the views aren’t bad, either. Along the 2,438-mile route, the train weaves through the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada, shifting scenery from cities to mountains to deserts. “It’s hard to not be inspired by all of the changes and beauty around you,” Ms. Wallick added. Each of the 50 or so video games made during Train Jam will be playable throughout the week at the cavernous Moscone Center, where the conference is being held. More than 26,000 people are expected to attend the 30th Game Developers Conference, which began on Monday and ends on Friday. That these little games are being given a platform on such a sizable stage is indicative of the industry’s kaleidoscopic expansion. Today a video game like Minecraft, originally built by a lone programmer in his bedroom, competes with the titans of the industry, such as Call of Duty and FIFA, which are made by a battalion of workers and supported by the screaming winds of multimillion-dollar marketing. That kind of blockbuster game making is a high-risk venture, with spiraling budgets and development cycles that can last three years. Unproven ideas are perilous, leading most studios to cling to bankable sequels. Game jams, by contrast, are a low-risk way to experiment with new concepts without the need for a commercial aesthetic, an apolitical stance or a bug-free release. Two recent games — Surgeon Simulator, about a hapless surgeon, and Goat Simulator, about an anarchic goat — are among the well-known irreverent games to spring from game jams. Even the games that don’t blossom into commercial releases can be useful. “It is a place to fail, happily,” said Susan Gold, founder of Global Game Jam, which invites people to join in, wherever they’re based, during a 48-hour period. Two days is enough time to explore an idea without burning out, and at these jams, programmers, writers, musicians, artists and project managers can all find a use for their talents. The format also encourages networking and stepping outside a rigid development repertoire. For those who usually work with sprawling teams, a game jam can break the monotony and bring fresh focus. For independent game makers who work alone, it can be an opportunity to test an idea, socialize and share skills. Train Jam accentuates the sense of expedition that comes with all creative work. Like any collaboration, game making is full of diversions and rewrites. A train journey, by contrast, is mostly predictable; the landscape may change, but everybody starts and ends at the same point. Placing game making within the context of a journey provides useful constraints. The term “game jam” was coined by the wunderkind programmer Chris Hecker, known for his work on the pioneering artificial-intelligence-based game Spore. In 2002, he invited 13 friends to join him in Oakland, Calif., to make games over a four-day period. They called it Indie Game Jam, a reference to musical jam sessions. Since Mr. Hecker’s event, the format has been adopted around the world, with jams unfolding in unusual places, often to a theme. February’s Splash Jam, for example, was held during a 745-mile cruise along the coast of Norway. Its 100 participants were tasked with making games related to “Beginnings.” Isolation Jam, which takes place in June, is set on a remote, Internet-less farm in northern Iceland. Castle Jam changes its location each year. For Asylum Jam, participants make horror games without the genre clichés related to mental health. Ms. Gold’s inaugural Global Game Jam was in 2009. She started the event with the aim of coordinating a game jam on every continent. “I was thinking that maybe we would get 10 or 20 locations to sign up,” she said. But more than 1,500 people took part in 23 countries. By this January, the number had risen to close to 40,000 participants in 93 countries. They created more than 6,800 games, many of which are available free to download and sample. The rise of game jams also shows a mounting appetite for alternatives to sports and shooter games. Lyst Jam is a Scandinavian game jam, held in June, in which attendees make video games about romance, love and sex. (Lyst is the Swedish word for lust.) “We feel the medium misrepresents the world we live in, and needs to be less narrow in gender, stories, themes and game mechanics,” said Andrea Hasselager, the jam’s organizer. “There’s an intense feeling of belonging to a group,” she said. “Combine that with a space where you shut out the concerns of everyday life, and the adrenaline rush of working all night and day to see something come to life, and it becomes irresistible.” For Adam Saltsman, an independent game maker from Austin, Tex., whose hit game Canabalt was conceived during a game jam, the appeal is more straightforward. “I think nerds like to party and make stuff,” he said. “It’s also a nice way to kind of get a bunch of resources into one geographical location, and it’s a great excuse to try something new.”    \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Monster Train has one hell of a premise. You're the conductor of a locomotive descending through the seven layers of hell—the denizens of the underworld hot on your tail. Harpies, warlocks, and abyssal knights are constantly breaching the walls, and players have to muster their own infernal forces to consign the interlopers back to the pits. In the hands of a gigantic studio like Blizzard or Ubisoft or EA, it'd be easy to imagine Monster Train as a sprawling, open-world adventure. We'd explore every nook and cranny of perdition—following waypoints, climbing watch towers, maxing out talent trees. But Shiny Shoe, the developer behind the game, chose a different direction entirely. Instead of a globe-trotting action game or a titanic RPG, Monster Train is a relatively simple digital card game, where the struggle against the Seraphim plays out with a deck and a dream. In 2021, that was more than enough to blow up the charts. \"Card games are something that's a lot more accessible to us and other indie studios as a format. In fact, a lot of triple-A studios are kinda staying away from them. We want to do the things that they aren't,\" says Andrew Krausnick, creative director of Monster Train, in an interview with WIRED. \"We're not going to compete with Call of Duty or whatever.\" Monster Train has been a runaway success. The game consistently racks up thousands of concurrent players on Steam, and its Metacritic average sits at a solid 86. The core gameplay will be familiar to veterans of board games like Dominion or Thunderstone: The player starts with a small, weak deck and slowly adds better pieces to it over the course of a campaign, eventually molding it into an efficient, demon-killing machine.  That is a paradigm shift. For decades, there's been a quiet schism between the video game and tabletop communities. The two industries rarely mingled, and when they did, it was usually in the form of a licensed adaptation—the mobile version of Pandemic, for example. But lately, in an ecosystem of airtight MOBAs, 60-frames-per-second shooters, and endless RPGs, many gamers prefer to drag and drop cards on a computer. Monster Train isn't alone. We are living through a renaissance of video games that take direct influence from tabletop ideas. Take 2017’s Slay the Spire, one of the most popular games on the internet. A lonely knight ventures through a grim gauntlet of beasties, slowly adding better cards to their deck. There's Dicey Dungeons, a roguelike that applies Yahtzee-style rolling to maximize absurd combos, like you're shaking up a grip of dice on the kitchen counter. In Loop Hero, an early 2021 darling, players slam down sets of mountain tiles and forest grottos as if they're constructing the city of Carcassonne, because in this adventure, there is nothing more powerful than a four-of-a-kind. All of these games come from indie studios, and each of them proudly don their influences. In today's gaming culture, the next big hit can fit into a regulation deck. That is the belief of Chalit Noonchoo, game lead of Gordian Quest, an RPG released onto Steam Early Access last year that melds elements of Dungeons & Dragons character construction with thoughtful deck-building strategy. Like Krausnick, Noonchoo says that card games are much more achievable for the average small studio compared to other, more technical genres. \"It makes us less beholden to expectations like having triple-A visuals, tons of animations, or heavy cut scenes that are difficult to pull off for us,\" he says. \"We try and focus our limited resources into making the game look and feel good at the most basic level.\" He holds up his end of the bargain. The core appeal of games like Gordian Quest is the sublime precision of the gameplay—there is a certain clarity that comes from staring at a hand of cards that can't be replicated elsewhere. But Noonchoo makes it clear that there is nothing straightforward about merging the digital and analog realms. If anything, Gordian Quest has required him to completely rethink how game design works. \"There's a lot more granular control and flow in a traditional game. Status effects can last for fractions of a second, area of effects can be increased by marginal percentages, and damage ranges can be scaled up to the thousands or millions,\" he says. \"In a card game, it is important to keep numbers small and each bonus impactful, as the player only has so much bandwidth to mentally track the components of every play, which presents an additional layer of challenge for us.\" Of course, one of the advantages of building a board game for PCs is the ability to pave over some of the annoying inefficiencies of tabletop. Nobody needs to reshuffle their discard pile in Monster Train, and all of the damage calculations happen automatically. Krausnick notes that one of his favorite mechanics in the game is the ability to duplicate cards in your deck. An idea like that would be untenable if Monster Train was played in a dining room, but on Steam, all it takes is a single line of code. Perhaps that's one of the reasons this digitized interpretation of the genre has penetrated into the mainstream. The finicky, mathematical upkeep of, say, an average game of Magic is nowhere to be found. Instead, the all-seeing power of the algorithm guides us every step of the way. \"We can let the mechanics get more complicated without becoming inaccessible,\" says Krausnick. \"In a physical game, you'd have to run the numbers and play it out, and it'd take four hours to play.\" All of this makes you consider where the industry will go from here. The tabletop industry is enjoying a historic boom, growing 20 percent in 2020 alone, which means that the avenues of influence into the Steam charts will likely stay open for quite some time. But Thomas Moon Kang, creator of the real-time card battler One Step From Eden, has a different theory. He notes that some of the most popular board games of the past few years (Gloomhaven, Pandemic: Legacy, Mansions of Madness) all attempt, in various different ways, to imitate video games. Some of these games use a downloadable app to streamline enemy AI, others come packed with a progressive narrative that offers more atmosphere and white-knuckle anxiety than the average Friday night round of Catan could ever deploy. Kang sees a symbiosis here, a world where board game designers and video game designers are each borrowing from the strengths of the other. \"Those lines are blending together,\" he says. \"I think it's eye-opening for developers and players.\" Let that be proof that the long cold war between PC gamers and tabletop gamers is finally over. Let us all enjoy a reality where ancient Pathfinder grognards, Gen Z Fortnite maestros, and unrepentant Crusader Kings lifers can exist as one. The equilibrium of geekdom has finally arrived.    \n",

more humanlike robots: software that enables machines to learn to walk like toddlers. Humans are very efficient at maneuvering. As kids, we figure out how to adjust our stride and cadence to trek through mud, water, and up and down hills with ease. Through trial and error, we adapt, figuring out the best ways to move our feet according to real-time situations. And we can do this while toting a variety of objects, either in our hands or on our backs.  It’s tough to program robots to make instantaneous adjustments to their legs and feet to accommodate such a variety of tasks, mainly because it’s hard to train them to deal with corner cases, or objects and environments they’ve never seen before. This is one of the main things AI struggles with today, said David Cox, IBM director of the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, a collaborative effort between IBM and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"How do you build systems that can adapt to all the corner cases they may see?” Advanced robot navigation could revolutionize services in a wide range of fields such as emergency response, agriculture, autonomous driving and manufacturing. It could hold the key to more complex chore robots. But it also requires teaching machines to act in the same way humans do subconsciously, based on lived experience — something that, at best, would be tedious and potentially impossible. Why it will be years before robot butlers take over your household chores Humans learn to navigate new environments by stumbling and trying again. But that’s an expensive and lengthy undertaking when applied to robots, which need to be fixed or have their code tweaked when damaged. Researchers try to avoid this by simulating new environments and adjusting robot brains accordingly. It’s a challenge Facebook says it has solved in collaboration with the University of California, Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon University.  First, researchers used simulations to train AI to respond to various environmental conditions, such as slippery ground or a sudden incline. Then, they taught a generic dog-like robot to learn from its mistakes and keep walking as far as possible despite sudden changes to its environment. They layered the two strategies, and together they “enable the robot to perform robust and adaptive locomotion without any fine tuning,” Facebook says. What this means is that AI allows them to adapt to factors in their environment without having seen them first. Rather than trying to avoid disruptions, they learn from surprises and move with them. Through the observation AI, each new leg movement is informed by previous ones. Obstacles that push against the robot’s feet or legs can reveal information about the ground around it. The AI learns from that. The so-called Rapid Motor Adaptation software might allow companies to create cheaper automated machines that figure out how to operate at peak performance with more affordable, not-as-accurate hardware. Cheaper robots are a critical step toward more advanced robots in more fields. Facebook showed off its AI development in a video. An eerie four-legged robot is shown pacing through the woods with relative ease. But when brought inside and tested in other situations, such as slippery surfaces, it had balance issues and difficulty walking. In one example, when weighted bags were placed on its back, the robot fell over. With Facebook’s AI software enabled, it wobbled but managed to stay upright and keep walking when the bags were tossed onto it. There are no cameras on the device. All of the robot’s movements were guided by sensors in its feet and various joints, which allow it to experience the world through “touch.”  Researchers compare it to what happens when humans try to walk on the sand at the beach for the first time. “The first few steps are awkward, but after a few steps, you’re walking on a beach as normally as you would on a hard road surface,” said Jitendra Malik, a computer vision researcher at Facebook AI and UC Berkeley. The team studied scientific literature on how children learn to walk to inform their project. Facebook isn’t the only big tech firm trying to create software that makes robots act more like real people. IBM, for instance, is researching AI methods that simulate raising a baby to understand what “common sense” knowledge a child gains, which can be applied to robotics. Last year, Google published a framework for wheeled robots to move through “unforeseen environments.” Boston Dynamics, a pioneer in agile, mobile robots, has a system on its Spot robots so they can “feel” the ground beneath them to try to avoid falling in low visibility. Facebook’s system was built on a $2,700 Unitree robot. Boston Dynamics’ Spot robot costs $74,500.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 WAYNESBORO, Ga. — In the two months since Richard Watson strapped 200 remote-control-sized transmitters around his cows’ necks, an artificial-intelligence system named Ida has pinged his phone with helpful alerts: when his cows are chewing the cud, when they’re feeling sick, when they’re ready for insemination.  “There may be 10 animals out there that have a real problem, but could you pick them?” he said one morning, standing among a grazing herd of dairy cattle wearing what he calls “cow Fitbits.” But on neighboring pastures here in rural Georgia, other farmers say they aren’t that impressed. When a cow’s in heat, they know she’ll start getting mounted by her bovine sisters, so they apply a streak of paint on the cows’ backsides and then just look for the incriminating smudge. No fancy AI required. “I can spot a cow across a room that don’t feel great just by looking in her eyes,” said Mark Rodgers, a fourth-generation dairy farmer in Dearing, Ga., whose dad still drives a tractor at 82. “The good Lord said, ‘This is what you can do.’ I can’t draw, paint or anything else, but I can watch cows.”  Sophisticated AI technologies are helping reinvent how Americans work, offering powerful software that can read and react to mountains of data and save time and stress along the way. But the rollout is also sparking tensions in workplaces as humble and old-fashioned as the dairy farm. That down-home resistance raises a question farmers might be tackling before much of the rest of the workforce: Can new technology ever beat old intuition — even when it comes to a bunch of cows? The AI that Watson’s farm uses — called Ida, for “The Intelligent Dairy Farmer’s Assistant” — tracks his cows’ tiniest movements through their collars and then graphs and dissects them en masse. Those “real-time cattle analytics” are then used by the AI to assess diet and movement and predict health issues of concern, such as lameness or udder infections.  As silly as this intricate level of maximum optimization might sound, particularly in relation to a herd of cows that spend much of the day staring blankly or relieving themselves,Watson said, it could mean the difference between a cow’s healthy milking or premature death — and the difference between making or losing hundreds of thousands of dollars every year. The Ida AI has sparked some early interest among farmers eager to compete in an industry in which low milk prices and farm layoffs have everyone on edge. And while truck drivers and ­cashiers see AI as an omen of job elimination, the farmers say they’re in a labor crunch from years of too few young people getting into farming and need all the help they can get. Connecterra, a development team based in the Netherlands, built Ida with help from TensorFlow, the giant AI toolbox that Google created for its own apps and opened to the public in 2015. That release sparked a major wave of AI development, giving start-ups a shortcut to calculating advanced mathematics and creating learning machines.  Google has joined other tech giants in pushing forcefully into AI, with chief executive Sundar Pichai telling a town-hall crowd in January that AI “is one of the most important things humanity is working on” and “more profound than electricity or fire.” (He did not explicitly mention cows.) Standing one March morning among his cows at Seven Oaks Dairy, one of three farms he runs as part of his Hart Agriculture brand, Watson pulls out his iPhone to show off his Ida app. The AI says he has three “potential health problems to be checked” among his herd: Cow #14433 is eating less, while cows #10172 and #3522 are “ruminating,” or chewing, less, a sign they might feel ill. His herd’s cows “to be inseminated” count is at zero, as signified by a reassuring green check mark.  At 6-foot-4, with combine-wide shoulders and a Kiwi accent, the New Zealand-born Watson, 46, looks like a rugby player — which he was, playing a linebacker-like position in the late 1990s for a semiprofessional team called the Hurricanes. Shortly afterward, he moved to lead a cattle-grazing research program at the University of Georgia, where he taught and advocated for the increasingly rare practice of letting cows amble about aimlessly on a pasture, eating as they go. His farm’s cattle — crossbreeds of America’s classic black and white moo cow, the Holstein, and New Zealand’s relatively slimmer brown Jersey bulls — spend almost all day grazing on the thousands of acres of ryegrass and Bermuda grass on his farms. That makes tracking their free-range eating and movement harder than at the average American “confinement” dairy, where cows are kept in stalls and fattened on corn and grains. Spotting problems the old way required closely watching the herd day and night, “unless it’s really obvious — you know, she’s walking or limping or there are buzzards flying overhead,” Watson said. “Buzzards aren’t a particularly good health program.” The cows’ orange transmitters beam data over the hills of Watson’s pastures to a set of antennae near the milking parlor. A “base station” computer then gulps up and processes all that sensor data, doing much of the AI work locally to avoid the problem of spotty rural Internet service. The sensors the animals wear pay the price for much of this data exchange, Connecterra co-founder Yasir Khokhar said: “You don’t want to know what cows do with them.” The Ida AI was first trained to comprehend cow behavior via thousands of hours of video and sensor inputs, as well as simpler approaches, including Khokhar’s mimicking bovine techniques with a sensor in his pocket. (“I was the first cow,” he said.) Every day brings more cow data and farmer feedback that help the AI learn and improve.The AI, Khokhar estimates, has processed about “600 cow years of data” and gains about eight years of new cow data every day.  The AI now logs seven distinct cow behaviors: walking, standing, lying down, eating, chewing, drinking and idling. Other behaviors are on the way, Khokhar said, though he could not disclose them, calling them part of the “secret sauce.” Dairy farmers have used sensors for years. But Ida’s developers say its AI can do things old programs can’t, by learning from cow behavior patterns that can pinpoint injuries, predict the onset of certain diseases and “predict peak ovulation time with over 90 percent accuracy.” The AI can also track how changes to cows’ bedding, feed and environment can affect, for instance, how much milk they’re making or how much they’re lying around. Khokhar, who said he conceived the AI idea while living on a Dutch dairy farm, launched his start-up in late 2016 and counts a few thousand cow “subscriptions” on farms in seven countries, including the United States, Spain and Pakistan. The company covers all the equipment and service work and sells monthly subscriptions. Farmers’ prices start at about $3 a month per cow, plus a $79.99-per-cow start-up fee, and Watson estimates he has invested about $17,000 in the system so far.  Agriculture has long been one of Big Technology’s juiciest target industries. Revamping the way farmers feed the planet, in the face of existential crises such as food shortages and climate change, would be audacious, revolutionary — and highly profitable. Start-ups and farmers are using camera-equipped robots to pick apples and sort cucumbers, running driverless tractors to harvest grain, and flying scanner drones to spot poachers and survey livestock. Beyond the Ida collars, other tech start-ups make cow pedometers, robot milkers, tail sensors and electroshock collars that can stop or shift a herd. But even some farmers who have invested heavily in new technology balk at the idea of paying for more. Everett Williams, the 64-year-old head of the WDairy farm near Madison, Ga., said his farm has all kinds of sensors that print out who-knows-how-many reports on matters such as cow activity and whether wild hogs have gotten into his pens. They give him less data than the Ida AI would, he says, but he feels that he doesn’t have the space in his brain for another data stream. “You can only handle so many text alerts,” he said. Systems such as Connecterra also are enduring early criticism beyond the farm. Because AI can help detect early disorders and walking disabilities, conservationists have criticized the systems as encouraging the breeding of a super-cow by speeding underperformers to the slaughterhouse.  Rodgers, who runs his “daddy-daughter” family dairy farm in Dearing, Ga., said he’s no Luddite when it comes to farm technology. His “super-system” features cow-tracking transponders and, soon, a DeLaval VMS, which milks cows with laser-guided robot arms and is advertised as the “ultimate automatic milking machine.” His system, unlike Ida, doesn’t track cud-chewing or use AI to tell him which cows to watch or what to do. But he’s okay with that. That’s the way things have always been done here, and he hopes they’ll be that way for a long time. “There’s no substitute for watching your animals. It’s an art and a science, and I hope my daughter and nephew get better at it than I am,” he said. The cattle, he added, don’t care much about evolving with the times. “You cannot bore a cow to death.”   \n",
       "13817   Right now, most gaming news sites are busy putting together their mandatory 'most anticipated games of 2012' features – and most will include a title that looks nothing like anything else on the list. Journey. This desert-bound co-op adventure is the latest work from LA studio, thatgamecompany. Previously responsible for beautiful PlayStation experiments, Flow and Flower, the 12-person team has a unique approach to development, focusing on emotion and experience rather than conventional notions of design, challenge and structure.  The game's producer is Robin Hunicke, one of the most influential and inspiring figures on the US indie gaming scene. Starting out at Will Wright's Maxis studio she was a designer on Sims 2 and MySims before working on Steven Spielberg's BoomBlox puzzler. Now firmly ensconced at TGC, she's also a co-organiser of the Game Design Workshop and Experimental Gameplay Sessions at GDC and speaks at games festivals around the world. Her sessions at Nottingham's GameCity festival, which this year included a playthrough of Journey in the Old Market Square, have been among that wonderful event's highlights. Meanwhile, she's also currently completing a PhD in game design and AI. Recently, I got to chat to Hunicke about Journey, and about the future of interactive entertainment. Will artificial intelligence ever mean more that just effective path finding? And will games ever completely personalise their content to individual players? Hunicke was fascinating on all of this. Here's what she had to say. Starting your development career with a series like the Sims must have been a highly educational experience. What have been the lasting design lessons?Well, it had a huge fan site, and at the time that was really rare – you didn't really have social sites based around games. The Sims Exchange was a sort of strange phenomenon. That taught me how diverse a gaming audience can be. Also, my first experience of working in the games industry was at a studio that was well over 40% women – I was totally spoiled, I had no idea! The Sims was a completely different kind of game team at the time. I think now if you were to go and visit Zynga or one of the social games developers you would see that there's a similar mix, and a similar relationship with the players.  The development culture at thatgamecompany is very interesting, too. Is it true that you start out with an emotion that you want to explore or communicate through the game, and then you start on things like design and environment. Is that how Journey started?It is. Our approach is a combination of two things: the feeling that we want to communicate and create in the player, and then our own passions as developers.  So moving from Flower to Journey one of the things we really wanted to do was explore the online component. We'd never made an online game, we'd never made anything with a network backend. And also we'd never made a game with a character in it, so it was our first animated avatar! There were a lot of challenges – the simulated sand, the simulated cloth, all the animation systems – that's all new. We were really passionate about expanding our technical capabilities and learning as developers.  There's something very evocative about the desert, something immediately beguiling and mysterious. Is this why you chose it?One of the things we talked about early in the project was this idea of creating a connection between players in an environment where you feel small and less empowered than you might in a tradition video game setting. We thought this would be conducive to a feeling of wanting to spend time together. And we wanted to create this connection without forcing it – we don't make you play with someone else, but we chose the desert setting because we thought a desolate and unfriendly place might actually encourage a connection between players.  The desire to make the player feel small within the game environment is totally at odds with what most titles try to do. And in your previous titles, Flow and Flower, the player is almost obliterated entirely as a virtual entity. And yet your projects have proved popular with 'core' gamers. Why is that?I guess it's that we offer the same kind of craftsmanship, art and care that would be put in to a very high-end core game. I think if you play mainstream games, you will understand what the components are in Journey – it's just that they're put together in a different way. And if you're into video games then of course you'll be into new experiences, right?! The co-founder of thatgamecompany, Kellee Santiago, has spoken a little about this, but I'm interested in your angle: why is it important for your co-op partner in Journey to remain anonymous, even when the game ends?Well, there's a lot of pressure associated with performing socially, when we spend time together. When you go out to a bar and meet new people, the quality of the experience is really determined by how well you connect – there's so much that you see in each other from the moment that you meet.  If you see a person's online identity, if you hear their voice, if they send you text messages, you're getting a lot of information that might get in the way rather than facilitate the connection. So we wanted to see – as an experiment – if we could take away a lot of that noise, in the same way that the desert takes away noise from the visuals. The tactile experience of moving through that environment is quite different from, say, a cityscape with tons of buildings and doors and stairs. Similarly, not being able to talk to each another, you just have to be together… And does the game have a traditional narrative to it?There's a reason behind the world. We spent a lot of time talking about why everything exists, what it meant before and what it means now, because the world has a history and a backstory. But the narrative of Journey is about what you do in it – it's really hard to describe to someone who hasn't played it. It's a little bit like a mirror – the way you engage in the experience… you take something away from it because of who you are. If you want to follow someone you may, if you want to lead, you can lead. These things create the narrative of your own journey. That's what we wanted – we wanted to leave it up to the player, the individual.  That's intriguing, because I think it's a key question in modern game design. I wrote a feature earlier this year about Deus Ex and how much freedom you can really give to a player. How much do they want? Is this something you thought about while designing Journey?Yes, and actually Warren Spector [designer of Deus Ex], has always been a huge influence on me; we spent a long time talking about Journey when I was down at Fantastic Fest. He asked me the same thing: how much agency do I have in this setting?  It's a very interesting philosophical question. What would it be like if you could live the same life over and over again, and see the same things over and over, but with the ability to change them, like Groundhog Day? If you have a favourite hike you regularly go on, it's always the same, but yet also never the same. That is how Journey is attempting to be – like a place that you visit, and while you're there you experience yourself and other people, but it is effectively the same Journey. But then it isn't! Do you know what I mean? I do, but then I worry that modern game design orthodoxy is moving toward prescriptive narrative experiences and away from player agency and interpretation…It's expensive and difficult to find new things, to do systems engineering for tactile experiences, for nuanced gameplay. It takes a lot of time. What I talked about at GameCity was, well, why did Journey take us three years to develop? A lot of people would be hard-pressed to justify that sort of effort to a corporate entity. It's expensive and it takes a lot of energy.  We're a small studio, we can get by, but if you had 300 people doing that, it would become really scary. We stay small because we want to be able to experiment – that's the nature of what we do. It's like research. And we always wonder – will this be the one that doesn't work? But I think we're at the beginning of a trend – a lot of indie developers are doing things that are similarly exploratory. Whether or not they'll ever be as large as Call of Duty, I'm not sure. But maybe that doesn't matter.  But then, are indie games being experimental enough? I thought that, by now, we'd see a totally procedurally generated game, which creates unique landscapes, populates them with intelligent characters and leaves the rest up to the player. I actually think there's a real buzz about this in the community. I was at IndieCade recemtly, and Casey Reas, Robert Hodgin and Zach Gage all gave talks about procedurally generated environments and working with generated events and content. It was very exciting. I heard a lot of people talking about how they're going to start working on procedurally generated stuff – so you may get your wish in about five years! But there have been examples – Darwinia, Minecraft – it's happening, it's just that it's happening in isolated areas. Maybe there will be a procedurally generated killer app that'll just turn the whole industry in that direction.And maybe thatgamecompany will make it – you never know! Do you actually have a whole bunch of future projects written down somewhere at thatgamecompany or do you very much work on one thing at a time?No, we are a one-game studio. But we'll have conversations about what's happening in game design, so we're aware of the milieu that we exist in.  Journey has been such a long project – three years with a team of 12 people. Have there been any real screaming matches in the office?Every once in a while there'll be a very heated discussion. We're close to the end of the game now, so we've been talking a lot about the story and what Journey means. The last meeting we had was actually very constructive and polite – we've reached the point on the project where the things we're all passionate about are in the game. Now it's just a case of getting it done. That's the best part. It's always the middle of the project that's the most angsty! Something that's certainly happening right now is this idea of dynamic difficulty and procedural mission creation in games. We saw it with the AI director in Left 4 Dead and we're seeing it with the personal quests in Skyrim. That sounds like a move towards procedural generation.It does, and one of the things that excites me is thinking about how you can get so much data from a player, in the way that they move and choose things. If we spent more time paying attention to what they are really doing we would be able to create games that react in much more elaborate ways.  Thinking about a game that knows itself as a game, that engages you in the way that a human games master would is really fascinating. You could probably just attach procedural outcomes to the behaviours of other humans within the game, then you wouldn't have to simulate everything yourself; one of the things that happens with Journey is that players assume the other character is an AI, which is very flattering, because we could never program a robot to do the things that a player does with that avatar. But you get a similar kind of experience when you play it because they're not interrupting you with their own thoughts and needs – it really is a lot more like playing with the game, but the game is being puppeted by another person. I think that's an interesting area to explore – what kinds of interfaces do games create between people, and how do we as designers manipulate the signal that goes from one player to another?  A lot of games seem to stop at simply facilitating a relationship between gamers – providing voice chat, for example. Yes, and that technology is like 50 years old! It's crazy that we haven't moved beyond that.  The idea of games being aware that they're games is fascinating. They're usually just systems that are sort of plonked in front of the player. I like the idea of something sentient within the game, guiding and altering the experience…Have you played the Stanley Parable? It's really amazing, it's a narrative game, but it has a quality to it… I don't want to spoil it, but there is a quality to the design and the way that the developers approach the problem that's very much about, what if games were sentient? What if there was something about the narrator that goes beyond the voice that comes through the speakers? That's a really fruitful area to explore.  The other thing that's been happening lately is, some designers have been able to build environments in which the player is also able to create games. Glitch by Tiny Speck, for example. The game world itself is an excuse for people to participate in an event with each other. From there on, it's kind of Wild West – they want to see what happens in a world where players can alter the environment.  And building a world where players see the game as an interface between each other, it's like going back to board games, but through digital technology, which is really fascinating.  Yes, and one of the things we lost in the move from, say, paper-and-pencil role-playing games was being able to cheat the system, or come up with your own rules…Exactly! And that's the way people learn how to become game designers. The way that we all experience design is as children when we're playing street games or board games and we decide to change the rules to see what happens. Those kinds of instincts should be embraced rather than squished as we go through school; I expect we'll then see a lot more people ready to explore those possibilities with the technology they have.  You're just finishing a PhD on Artificial Intelligence aren't you? Yes, I was researching the AI system in Half-Life, which is like the AI director in Left 4 Dead but more primitive. I was fascinated by this idea of a program that changed itself based on what you did. If you look at Journey, you'll see that the design is taking part in an exchange with the machine. The computer is working with you to create this experience, it is mediating between you and the other player. People write to us at TGC and talk about how they've had these amazingly emotional experiences with Flower – people really fell in love with that program. And really, that's the goal, to develop a piece of software that creates a lasting connection with another person. But the problem with the way the games industry approaches AI is that its so prescriptive and functional – it's all about better path-finding and being able to flank the player in a shooting game…Well, the joy and the pain of working with robots, which I did at school, is that you quickly realise in order to get anything to work, you have to really simplify the universe. You paint a white line around the walls so they can follow it, you create a special system that lets them recognise corners… I did a lot of work with sonar early on. Then I just moved on to working with Half-Life because it was easier to program the in-game bots than it was to program real robots. But you quickly realise it's the same problem: you have to simplify the environment in order to bring about progress. And as a game developer, what happens is, you just get more and more objects in your world – everything can move, individual agents can move things – so now your planning has to be that much more complex. As environments become more dynamic, you're always on the treadmill of trying to solve the same problem. But yes, it would be nice if we also worked on new technologies using AI to create game play. Michael Mateas has a laboratory at UC Santa Cruz and the whole focus is to do procedurally generative design for art and games. He believes that if you work on procedural systems you can generate new kinds of games – but you can't do it the other way around; you can't think of those games then design the systems that will make them. I think that work is groundbreaking.  AI in games now is about simulating believability. If you want to simulate hidden information then you also have to simulate the suspicion of information, which is what most stealth games do. So if the player makes a noise, an AI enemy will say, 'hey, what was that?! I'm coming to investigate' and then you know to hide. It really is like an advanced game of tag, and you're just programming a tag bot – which is research that was done at CNU many, many years ago! It's strange how many of our fundamental game systems are pretty decrepit now…But at the same time, we build with what we know – that's what makes TGC such a special place. We could have made a forced co-op platform puzzler with really basic mechanics that were recognisable to the gaming community. But what we ended up doing was taking away everything that wasn't central to the thesis and then trying to design the systems that would make it feel great. Maybe that's not for everybody, but I wouldn't want to work in any other way. Journey will be released on PlayStation Network in spring, 2012.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The backlash against tech began in books. In the 2010s, when Google’s motto “Don’t be evil” felt unironic and TED talks lauding the Internet as the great social equalizer still drew credulous audiences, books such as Eli Pariser’s “The Filter Bubble” and Shoshana Zuboff’s “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism” were defining terms that would massively shift public opinion. Over the next decade, technology, or more specifically software, would come to be seen less as an innovative convenience and more as a harbinger of societal turmoil.  In 2022, anti-tech is mainstream. Ideas that originated in books about how platforms and their undergirding artificial-intelligence algorithms threaten society have made their way into Netflix documentaries, op-eds, bipartisan legislation and even the latest “Space Jam” (with supervillain Al-G Rhythm, played by Don Cheadle). Technology scholars such as Lina Khan and Meredith Whittaker, once considered fringe for their criticisms of technology’s structural harms, have found themselves with prominent appointments in the Biden administration. The world is finally listening to technology critics. So now the question is: What should they write about next? The easy answer is to ride the wave of tech’s new unpopularity, and that is the option NBC News tech correspondent Jacob Ward chose in writing “The Loop: How Technology Is Creating a World Without Choices and How to Fight Back.” The book argues that capitalistic AI technologies “prey on our psychological frailties” and threaten to create “a world in which our choices are narrowed, human agency is limited, and our worst unconscious impulses dominate society.” More than telling readers anything new about the dangers of technology, though, “The Loop” provides evidence that tech criticism itself is calcifying into a mainstream genre. The titular “loop” that Ward warns his readers about is rooted in the power, predictability and stupidity of our unconscious minds. When humans make decisions, our brains are quick to take shortcuts. In doing so, we make predictable, systematic errors such as miscalculating risk and overtrusting authority. Technology companies, Ward argues, use algorithms to hijack these unconscious patterns for profit. The “loop” is Ward’s speculation that our ever-increasing dependence on AI products — Spotify for music recommendations, social media algorithms for news, automated weapons for waging war — drives our thoughtlessness, which in turn makes us more dependent on AI, and so on. “In a generation or two,” Ward posits, “we’ll be an entirely different species — distracted, obedient, helpless to resist the technologies we use to make our choices for us, even when they’re the wrong choices.”  Throughout the book, Ward interviews technologists, academics and everyday users to understand how different AI products have become inextricably woven into people’s lives. In one section, he talks to people addicted to “social casino games,” free-to-play gambling simulators that lull users, often poor and in dark places in their lives, into spending tens of thousands of real dollars on in-game currency. In another, Ward rides along with police officers as they patrol a beat dictated by PredPol (now Geolitica), an infamously racially biased algorithm that predicts where crime will occur based on past incidents. Ward asks, “What happens when budgets and schedules for policing are built on the assumption that a software subscription can replace the need to pay overtime for detectives?” For people and institutions alike, once AI is introduced, it’s hard to remove. More often than not, though, Ward’s examples don’t fit into his neat conception of AI as a force for evil. Take his discussion of the 2017 incident aboard United Airlines Flight 3411 when security officers physically dragged David Dao, a physician, off an overbooked plane; he had refused to leave after being selected more or less randomly for involuntary removal. Ward describes Dao not as a victim of violently bad customer service but as an enlightened freedom fighter who stood strong against a dictatorial algorithm. “Everyone — from the flight attendants who insisted Dao change flights despite the consequences for his patients, to the young couple that got off when asked, to the officers summoned to remove Dao — was acting under the direction of a larger, mysterious machine.” Ward could have used the United incident to engage with hard questions about when algorithms should be used to make decisions and how those decisions should be communicated. Instead, he uses it as another opportunity to shake his fist at a computer that ruined everything. Ward rails with equal vigor against AI that demonstrably improves people’s lives. He interviews Yacqueline, a divorced woman who has trouble managing hostility against her ex as they negotiate time with their 5-year-old son. A judge orders that she and her former husband communicate through coParenter, a messaging app for divorced parents that uses AI to detect and mitigate hostile language. Yacqueline describes the app as a godsend, but Ward sees only danger. “Are Yacqueline and her ex modeling anything for [their son] at all, except the bland collegiality they’re reading line for line from a series of AI-driven prompts? . . . Is this training? Or are these training wheels that never come off?” Any evidence to the contrary, such as how Yacqueline never learned such conflict-management skills from her own, AI-less divorced parents, Ward ignores. “The Loop” has the right anecdotes to wrestle with the ethical ambiguity of AI, but instead it tries to prove that AI is, almost without exception, bad. Ward seems to have drawn the wrong lessons from the techlash authors who came before him: Rather than following their methods of considering from all angles and questioning the status quo, he rides the new status quo they helped establish. Today, the challenge of criticizing AI-driven capitalism and technology writ large is that it is hard to come up with an argument that readers whose brains have been sufficiently warped by the Internet couldn’t intuit themselves. Some recent books have stepped up to the challenge — Kate Crawford’s “Atlas of AI” and Logic Magazine’s recent four-book series on the tech industry, for example, shed new light on AI’s environmental impact and shady labor practices. But “The Loop,” like many books that set out to prove that technology is unequivocally bad, has little new to offer. Instead, it continues to clang the bell of anti-tech rabble-rousing, a sound we’ve all heard before and don’t need to hear again.

In a rare move for a console's launch, Sony has led the charge by announcing a direct-sales program—one that bypasses typical retail channels—before the upcoming system's price, release date, or other details have been announced. This story originally appeared on, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Condé Nast. Starting Wednesday, prospective buyers can go to Sony's official preorder site to express their interest in purchasing a PS5. Users only need to enter one piece of information into the form: their PlayStation Network ID. And ... that's it. From there, Sony will determine exactly who will be deigned worthy of a shot at purchasing a PS5, and this will be based on \"previous interests and PlayStation activities.\" Exactly what that information is, and how it will be weighted, is currently unclear. Years of membership? Number of games owned? Whether the account in question pays for subscription services like PlayStation Plus or PlayStation Now, or merely uses a wholly free PSN account? Sony has yet to clarify this point. If you've been selected as part of Sony's direct preorder program, you'll find out at some point (currently unknown) via an email sent to the address registered to your PSN account. (Hence, today would be a good day to double-check that address and other PSN profile information.) If you didn't get into Sony's preorder program, you won't receive the bad news in the form of an email or any other notification. And while PSN IDs from all over the world will be eligible for this program, orders will only work if they ship to US addresses. It's unclear whether Sony will roll out similar campaigns for other territories. With that email, you'll be told the exact time window you have to place an order of a PS5 console, which can either be the standard version (with a disc drive) or the \"Digital Version\" (no disc drive). Sony has emphasized a limit of one PS5 console per PSN ID. Invited PSN users will also be able to directly order PS5 peripherals with their console, including DualSense controllers, headsets, cameras, media remotes, and controller charging stands. No peripheral bundle will be forced upon buyers in Sony's direct-sales program. Sony's language implies, but doesn't quite confirm, that this PSN-related program will be the very first one in the world to offer PS5 console preorders. Meaning, Sony may beat typical retailers like Gamestop, Amazon, and Best Buy to the preorder party. It's another major blow to the usual retailer product chain, which was already disrupted by Sony giving fans the option of punting discs with the Digital Edition and buying all their games directly from PlayStation Network. We're still waiting to hear exactly how much the console will cost and when it will begin shipping to customers and retailers, but other crucial details remain unanswered before a program like this rolls out. How much will all of PS5's peripherals cost—particularly the brand-new DualSense controller, which looks bulkier and adds more sensitive functions (particularly its haptic feedback system) than any previous first-party PlayStation gamepad? What kind of built-in capacity should we expect for the PS5's solid-state drive, and what requirements should we expect for add-on NVMe drives?\\nWhich previously announced games will launch alongside the console? (So far, we only know about Spider-man: Miles Morales as a first-party PS5 game for 2020, but whether it will accompany the console's launch is still unknown. Comparatively, Microsoft originally announced Halo Infinite as a launch title for this year's Xbox Series X, only to pull back.) Most of all, will fans know the price before this preorder program goes live, or will interested buyers have mere milliseconds to swallow the price tag before placing their preorder amongst a crazed mob of specially selected PSN users? Sony likely isn't incentivized to let anyone mull the price tag, considering how high we expect it will be—and third-party game publishers are already revving fans' wallets in the form of higher next-gen game prices.

                                Delirious, deranged, gonzo or just gone, baby, gone  no single adjective or even a pileup does justice to “House,” a 1977 Japanese haunted-house freakout. Directed by Nobuhiko Obayashi, this energetic exemplar of pulp surrealism began surfacing in the United States last year, playing at events like the New York Asian Film Festival. Now, in advance of the Criterion DVD, which will be released later this year, it is receiving its first, must-see-now domestic theatrical run at the IFC Center in New York. A midnight movie in lysergic spirit and vibe, this was a film made for late-night screening and screaming. The yelps you’ll hear and possibly emit, though, will be of surprise and delight, not terror. “House,” which turns on a misbegotten, increasingly violent trip taken by seven teenage girls, is not in the least scary, despite its body count and gore. If the hairs on your neck snap to attention, it will be only because of Mr. Obayashi’s flamboyant visual style, his comic flights of fancy and genre manipulations. This might be about a haunted house, but it’s the film that is more truly possessed: in one scene a piano bites off the fingers of a musician tickling its keys; in another a severed head tries to take a bite out of a girl’s rear, snapping at the derrière as if it were an apple. Later a roomful of futons goes on the attack. The decapitated noggin also flies through the air, but that’s getting, um, ahead of the story, which opens with two uniformed teenage girls putting on a little photo shoot, prettily posing and laughing. You quickly discover that one, who’s known as Gorgeous (Kimiko Ikegami), a moniker used by both her friends and father (Saho Sasazawa), is the center from which all the other chaotic parts flow and twist. Although she seems like a model daughter (her insistent smile could light up Tokyo or at least a toothpaste commercial), she churns with jealousy after her father introduces her to his new girlfriend, Ryoko (Haruko Wanibuchi), another wide-smiling beauty whose lightly billowing hair and clothes suggest that she keeps company with an off-screen wind machine. In a bid to get away from home, Gorgeous decides to visit her dead mother’s sister (Yoko Minamida). The aunt agrees in a letter that arrives, partly or so it seems, with the help of a white cat that inexplicably materializes one day. Gorgeous enlists six of her friends as accompaniment, a giggling retinue of nymphs fancifully named Sweet, Melody, Fantasy, Prof, Mac and Kung Fu. Traveling by train, wheels and foot, they arrive at an isolated house, where the aunt, who’s in a wheelchair (if not for long!), lives with her white cat, whose eyes beam out ominous green sparks and who has been immortalized in artwork throughout the house. Things soon start to go very badly for the teenagers. It’s easy to track the plot points in “House” and rather more difficult to grasp why Mr. Obayashi tells the story the way he does, to gauge the significance of the gaudy colors, the old-fashioned techniques (he periodically irises up and down), the superimpositions and flurries of jump cuts. The exterior backdrops tend to be overtly artificial, the skies so streaked with orange that you half expect to see Scarlett O’Hara shaking her fist at the heavens. A scene with Gorgeous, her father and his new squeeze, meanwhile, is shot through a multipaned window that separates the camera (and us) from the characters, one of several such distancing strategies. There are close-ups, but many are so glossy and stylized that they look like advertisements. Some of these flourishes seem to express the interior states of the characters: the wind that gently stirs Ryoko’s hair and clothes whenever she steps in front of the camera suggests that she imagines herself as a kind of romantic figure. Similarly, the gauzy shot of a dreamy-looking girl playing the piano implies that she, too, sees herself in flattering soft focus. Then again, these visual fillips also bring to mind a story that the actor Bill Duke once told about working with the director Samuel Fuller. Mr. Duke asked Fuller why the camera was pointing up from beneath a glass table. Whose point of view is that? Mr. Duke wondered. It’s my point of view, Fuller responded, asserting his directorial prerogative. “House” was Mr. Obayashi’s first feature, and at times it feels as if he threw everything  every movie he had ever seen, every idea he had ever entertained  at the screen, using the horror genre as a big box into which he could combine the bits and pieces he wanted to sample from avant-garde cinema, Looney Tunes cartoons, schlock Italian horror and martial arts movies. One of the most arresting sequences, featuring pinwheeling female body parts, brings to mind various Surrealist collages and that movement’s representations of dismembered female forms. (One of Mr. Obayashi’s many features is “Sada,” a 1998 version of the same obsessive love story in Nagisa Oshima’s 1976 “In the Realm of the Senses,” about a woman who severs her lover’s penis.) Not much has been published in English on Mr. Obayashi, though there’s a useful overview of his life and work by Paul Roquet at midnighteye.com. Mr. Obayashi was born in 1938 and started making experimental films in his 20s, becoming involved in the 1960s with an art group whose members included Yoko Ono, before going on to a prolific career as a director of commercials. The press notes for “House” state that the story originated from the “eccentric musings” of his 11-year-old daughter, a nice, perverse touch. Whether “House” was her fantasy or his, Mr. Obayashi has created a true fever dream of a film, one in which the young female imagination  that of his daughter, Gorgeous or both  yields memorable results.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Hewlett-Packard just announced a new line of business computers. They include sensors in the racks and wires, and smart software. Perhaps it should also include a small prayer that its customers do not change too much                                         or too fast. The new machines, the ProLiant Generation 8 servers, are the product of two years of development costing $300 million. The company claims the machines have over 160 different upgrades and new features compared with                                         H.P.’s previous generation of servers, including things like automated updating of security patches that can cut server re-provisioning times to 10 minutes from 5 hours. Sensors in the server racks can tell                                         where machines are located and how they are performing. Performance tweaks yield 70 percent more computing power per watt, H.P. says. Fewer humans and more software, the company claims, can cut server downtime by                                         up to 93 percent. These are all changes that speak to the big concerns corporate buyers have about their growing computer systems: how can they keep track of things, afford the power demands, and keep this many densely packed semiconductors                                         from melting down under the heat they collectively generate? H.P. is also selling how much these systems can save on manpower costs, with much of the maintenance automated. (The computers can even send care messages                                         to H.P.’s resellers.) Companies may be able to unload staff members, but H.P. hopes they keep the machines themselves. After all, H.P. is a company with over $130 billion in annual revenues, and a good portion of that comes from having its                                         machines inside corporate data centers. If companies move to cloud systems, particularly clouds in which operators buy machines and equipment directly from cheaper suppliers like Flextronics, or Taiwan’s                                         Quanta, then H.P. has worries. Clouds are volume buys, meaning H.P. will have to compete at a lower profit margin. Jim Ganthier, H.P.’s vice president for server marketing, said his company was confident there is still a long future ahead for computing on premises. “Ultimately, it will all be a hybrid,” he said.                                         Corporate tech buyers “are smart folks,” he said. “They’ll vote for the team that will help them best.” In the long run, he said, the new line is also well-suited for cloud computing. H.P. is not just looking to hold onto individual sales to business. The software that tells resellers, powerful sales allies for H.P., when they need to service computers will help those resellers persuade their customers                                         to keep buying machines — and not move too fast to cloud computing. We’ll see if that works. This server upgrade, called Project Voyager, follows an announcement in November of Project Moonshot, which employs low-power cellphone chips to power servers in big data centers. (You don’t need to be a rocket                                         scientist to figure out that H.P. is naming all of its server programs after famous NASA programs.) A sales line announced in December, called Project Odyssey, allowed popular operating systems to be used in highly                                         demanding computing situations.    \n",

                                                                    Wealth and influence in the technology business have always been about gaining the upper hand in software or the machines that software ran on. Now data — gathered in those immense pools of information that are at the heart of everything from artificial intelligence to online shopping recommendations — is increasingly a focus of technology competition. And academics and some policy makers, especially in Europe, are considering whether big internet companies like Google and Facebook might use their data resources as a barrier to new entrants and innovation. In recent years, Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft have all been targets of tax evasion, privacy or antitrust investigations. But in the coming years, who controls what data could be the next worldwide regulatory focus as governments strain to understand and sometimes rein in American tech giants. The European Commission and the British House of Lords both issued reports last year on digital “platform” companies that highlighted the essential role that data collection, analysis and distribution play in creating and shaping markets. And the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development held a meeting in November to explore the subject, “Big Data: Bringing Competition Policy to the Digital Era.” As government regulators dig into this new era of data competition, they may find that standard antitrust arguments are not so easy to make. Using more and more data to improve a service for users and more accurately target ads for merchants is a clear benefit, for example. And higher prices for consumers are not present with free internet services. “You certainly don’t want to punish companies because of what they might do,” said Annabelle Gawer, a professor of the digital economy at the University of Surrey in England, who made a presentation at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development meeting. “But you do need to be vigilant. It’s clear that enormous power is in the hands of a few companies.” Maurice Stucke, a former Justice Department antitrust official and a professor at the University of Tennessee College of Law, who also spoke at the gathering, said one danger was that consumers might be afforded less privacy than they would choose in a more competitive market. The competition concerns echo those that gradually emerged in the 1990s about software and Microsoft. The worry is that as the big internet companies attract more users and advertisers, and gather more data, a powerful “network effect” effectively prevents users and advertisers from moving away from a dominant digital platform, like Google in search or Facebook in consumer social networks. Evidence of the rising importance of data can be seen from the frontiers of artificial intelligence to mainstream business software. And certain data sets can be remarkably valuable for companies working on those technologies. A prime example is Microsoft’s purchase of LinkedIn, the business social network, for $26.2 billion last year. LinkedIn has about 467 million members, and it houses their profiles and maps their connections. Microsoft is betting LinkedIn, combined with data on how hundreds of millions of workers use its Office 365 online software, and consumer data from search behavior on Bing, will “power a set of insights that we think is unprecedented,” said James Phillips, vice president for business applications at Microsoft. In an email to employees, Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, described the LinkedIn deal as a linchpin in the company’s long-term goal to “reinvent productivity and business processes” and to become the digital marketplace that defines “how people find jobs, build skills, sell, market and get work done.” IBM has also bet heavily on data for its future. Its acquisitions have tended to be in specific industries, like its $2.6 billion purchase last year of Truven Health, which has data on the cost and treatment of more than 200 million patients, or in specialized data sets useful across several industries, like its $2 billion acquisition of the digital assets of the Weather Company. IBM estimates that 70 percent of the world’s data is not out on the public web, but in private databases, often to protect privacy or trade secrets. IBM’s strategy is to take the data it has acquired, add customer data and use that to train its Watson artificial intelligence software to pursue such tasks as helping medical researchers discover novel disease therapies, or flagging suspect financial transactions for independent auditors. “Our focus is mainly on nonpublic data sets and extending that advantage for clients in business and science,” said David Kenny, senior vice president for IBM’s Watson and cloud businesses. At Google, the company’s drive into cloud-delivered business software is fueled by data, building on years of work done on its search and other consumer services, and its recent advances in image identification, speech recognition and language translation. For example, a new Google business offering — still in the test, or alpha, stage — is a software service to improve job finding and recruiting. Its data includes more than 17 million online job postings and the public profiles and résumés of more than 200 million people. Its machine-learning algorithms distilled that to about four million unique job titles, ranked the most common ones and identified specific skills. The job sites CareerBuilder and Dice are using the Google technology to show job seekers more relevant openings. And FedEx, the giant package shipper, is adding the service to its recruiting site. That is just one case, said Diane Greene, senior vice president for Google’s cloud business, of what is becoming increasingly possible — using the tools of artificial intelligence, notably machine learning, to sift through huge quantities of data to provide machine-curated data services. “You can turn this technology to whatever field you want, from manufacturing to medicine,” Ms. Greene said. Fei-Fei Li, director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, is taking a sabbatical to become chief scientist for artificial intelligence at Google’s cloud unit. She sees working at Google as one path to pursue her career ambition to “democratize A.I.,” now that the software and data ingredients are ripe. “We wouldn’t have the current era of A.I. without the big data revolution,” Dr. Li said. “It’s the digital gold.” In the A.I. race, better software algorithms can put you ahead for a year or so, but probably no more, said Andrew Ng, a former Google scientist and adjunct professor at Stanford. He is now chief scientist at Baidu, the Chinese internet search giant, and a leading figure in artificial intelligence research. Rivals, he added, cannot unlock or simulate your data. “Data is the defensible barrier, not algorithms,” Mr. Ng said.    \n",

Fascinated by data? The sound you hear is opportunity knocking. Mo Zhou was snapped up by I.B.M. last summer, as a freshly minted Yale M.B.A., to join the technology company’s fast-growing ranks of data consultants. They help businesses make sense of an explosion of data — Web traffic and social network comments, as well as software and sensors that monitor shipments, suppliers and customers — to guide decisions, trim costs and lift sales. “I’ve always had a love of numbers,” says Ms. Zhou, whose job as a data analyst suits her skills. To exploit the data flood, America will need many more like her. A report last year by the McKinsey Global Institute, the research arm of the consulting firm, projected that the United States needs 140,000 to 190,000 more workers with “deep analytical” expertise and 1.5 million more data-literate managers, whether retrained or hired. The impact of data abundance extends well beyond business. Justin Grimmer, for example, is one of the new breed of political scientists. A 28-year-old assistant professor at Stanford, he combined math with political science in his undergraduate and graduate studies, seeing “an opportunity because the discipline is becoming increasingly data-intensive.” His research involves the computer-automated analysis of blog postings, Congressional speeches and press releases, and news articles, looking for insights into how political ideas spread. The story is similar in fields as varied as science and sports, advertising and public health — a drift toward data-driven discovery and decision-making. “It’s a revolution,” says Gary King, director of Harvard’s Institute for Quantitative Social Science. “We’re really just getting under way. But the march of quantification, made possible by enormous new sources of data, will sweep through academia, business and government. There is no area that is going to be untouched.” Welcome to the Age of Big Data. The new megarich of Silicon Valley, first at Google and now Facebook, are masters at harnessing the data of the Web — online searches, posts and messages — with Internet advertising. At the World Economic Forum last month in Davos, Switzerland, Big Data was a marquee topic. A report by the forum, “Big Data, Big Impact,” declared data a new class of economic asset, like currency or gold. Rick Smolan, creator of the “Day in the Life” photography series, is planning a project later this year, “The Human Face of Big Data,” documenting the collection and uses of data. Mr. Smolan is an enthusiast, saying that Big Data has the potential to be “humanity’s dashboard,” an intelligent tool that can help combat poverty, crime and pollution. Privacy advocates take a dim view, warning that Big Data is Big Brother, in corporate clothing. What is Big Data? A meme and a marketing term, for sure, but also shorthand for advancing trends in technology that open the door to a new approach to understanding the world and making decisions. There is a lot more data, all the time, growing at 50 percent a year, or more than doubling every two years, estimates IDC, a technology research firm. It’s not just more streams of data, but entirely new ones. For example, there are now countless digital sensors worldwide in industrial equipment, automobiles, electrical meters and shipping crates. They can measure and communicate location, movement, vibration, temperature, humidity, even chemical changes in the air. Link these communicating sensors to computing intelligence and you see the rise of what is called the Internet of Things or the Industrial Internet. Improved access to information is also fueling the Big Data trend. For example, government data — employment figures and other information — has been steadily migrating onto the Web. In 2009, Washington opened the data doors further by starting Data.gov, a Web site that makes all kinds of government data accessible to the public. Data is not only becoming more available but also more understandable to computers. Most of the Big Data surge is data in the wild — unruly stuff like words, images and video on the Web and those streams of sensor data. It is called unstructured data and is not typically grist for traditional databases. But the computer tools for gleaning knowledge and insights from the Internet era’s vast trove of unstructured data are fast gaining ground. At the forefront are the rapidly advancing techniques of artificial intelligence like natural-language processing, pattern recognition and machine learning. Those artificial-intelligence technologies can be applied in many fields. For example, Google’s search and ad business and its experimental robot cars, which have navigated thousands of miles of California roads, both use a bundle of artificial-intelligence tricks. Both are daunting Big Data challenges, parsing vast quantities of data and making decisions instantaneously. The wealth of new data, in turn, accelerates advances in computing — a virtuous circle of Big Data. Machine-learning algorithms, for example, learn on data, and the more data, the more the machines learn. Take Siri, the talking, question-answering application in iPhones, which Apple introduced last fall. Its origins go back to a Pentagon research project that was then spun off as a Silicon Valley start-up. Apple bought Siri in 2010, and kept feeding it more data. Now, with people supplying millions of questions, Siri is becoming an increasingly adept personal assistant, offering reminders, weather reports, restaurant suggestions and answers to an expanding universe of questions. To grasp the potential impact of Big Data, look to the microscope, says Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management. The microscope, invented four centuries ago, allowed people to see and measure things as never before — at the cellular level. It was a revolution in measurement. Data measurement, Professor Brynjolfsson explains, is the modern equivalent of the microscope. Google searches, Facebook posts and Twitter messages, for example, make it possible to measure behavior and sentiment in fine detail and as it happens. In business, economics and other fields, Professor Brynjolfsson says, decisions will increasingly be based on data and analysis rather than on experience and intuition. “We can start being a lot more scientific,” he observes. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence of the payoff from data-first thinking. The best-known is still “Moneyball,” the 2003 book by Michael Lewis, chronicling how the low-budget Oakland A’s massaged data and arcane baseball statistics to spot undervalued players. Heavy data analysis had become standard not only in baseball but also in other sports, including English soccer, well before last year’s movie version of “Moneyball,” starring Brad Pitt. Retailers, like Walmart and Kohl’s, analyze sales, pricing and economic, demographic and weather data to tailor product selections at particular stores and determine the timing of price markdowns. Shipping companies, like U.P.S., mine data on truck delivery times and traffic patterns to fine-tune routing. Online dating services, like Match.com, constantly sift through their Web listings of personal characteristics, reactions and communications to improve the algorithms for matching men and women on dates. Police departments across the country, led by New York’s, use computerized mapping and analysis of variables like historical arrest patterns, paydays, sporting events, rainfall and holidays to try to predict likely crime “hot spots” and deploy officers there in advance. Research by Professor Brynjolfsson and two other colleagues, published last year, suggests that data-guided management is spreading across corporate America and starting to pay off. They studied 179 large companies and found that those adopting “data-driven decision making” achieved productivity gains that were 5 percent to 6 percent higher than other factors could explain. The predictive power of Big Data is being explored — and shows promise — in fields like public health, economic development and economic forecasting. Researchers have found a spike in Google search requests for terms like “flu symptoms” and “flu treatments” a couple of weeks before there is an increase in flu patients coming to hospital emergency rooms in a region (and emergency room reports usually lag behind visits by two weeks or so). Global Pulse, a new initiative by the United Nations, wants to leverage Big Data for global development. The group will conduct so-called sentiment analysis of messages in social networks and text messages — using natural-language deciphering software — to help predict job losses, spending reductions or disease outbreaks in a given region. The goal is to use digital early-warning signals to guide assistance programs in advance to, for example, prevent a region from slipping back into poverty. In economic forecasting, research has shown that trends in increasing or decreasing volumes of housing-related search queries in Google are a more accurate predictor of house sales in the next quarter than the forecasts of real estate economists. The Federal Reserve, among others, has taken notice. In July, the National Bureau of Economic Research is holding a workshop on “Opportunities in Big Data” and its implications for the economics profession. Big Data is already transforming the study of how social networks function. In the 1960s, Stanley Milgram of Harvard used packages as his research medium in a famous experiment in social connections. He sent packages to volunteers in the Midwest, instructing them to get the packages to strangers in Boston, but not directly; participants could mail a package only to someone they knew. The average number of times a package changed hands was remarkably few, about six. It was a classic demonstration of the “small-world phenomenon,” captured in the popular phrase “six degrees of separation.” Today, social-network research involves mining huge digital data sets of collective behavior online. Among the findings: people whom you know but don’t communicate with often — “weak ties,” in sociology — are the best sources of tips about job openings. They travel in slightly different social worlds than close friends, so they see opportunities you and your best friends do not. Researchers can see patterns of influence and peaks in communication on a subject — by following trending hashtags on Twitter, for example. The online fishbowl is a window into the real-time behavior of huge numbers of people. “I look for hot spots in the data, an outbreak of activity that I need to understand,” says Jon Kleinberg, a professor at Cornell. “It’s something you can only do with Big Data.” Big Data has its perils, to be sure. With huge data sets and fine-grained measurement, statisticians and computer scientists note, there is increased risk of “false discoveries.” The trouble with seeking a meaningful needle in massive haystacks of data, says Trevor Hastie, a statistics professor at Stanford, is that “many bits of straw look like needles.” Big Data also supplies more raw material for statistical shenanigans and biased fact-finding excursions. It offers a high-tech twist on an old trick: I know the facts, now let’s find ’em. That is, says Rebecca Goldin, a mathematician at George Mason University, “one of the most pernicious uses of data.” Data is tamed and understood using computer and mathematical models. These models, like metaphors in literature, are explanatory simplifications. They are useful for understanding, but they have their limits. A model might spot a correlation and draw a statistical inference that is unfair or discriminatory, based on online searches, affecting the products, bank loans and health insurance a person is offered, privacy advocates warn. Despite the caveats, there seems to be no turning back. Data is in the driver’s seat. It’s there, it’s useful and it’s valuable, even hip. Veteran data analysts tell of friends who were long bored by discussions of their work but now are suddenly curious. “Moneyball” helped, they say, but things have gone way beyond that. “The culture has changed,” says Andrew Gelman, a statistician and political scientist at Columbia University. “There is this idea that numbers and statistics are interesting and fun. It’s cool now.”    \n",
